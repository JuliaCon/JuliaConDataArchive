The physical processes governing natural systems' evolution are often mathematically described as systems of differential equations. In addition, the incredible amount of available data relating to these natural systems increases at unprecedented pace. Understanding and predicting the dynamic of the natural systems requires accurate predictive models built upon constraining parameters from differential equation solvers using a data-driven approach, where fast and accurate solutions require numerical implementations to leverage modern parallel hardware.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop is to offer an interactive hands-on to solve and constrain systems of differential equations in parallel on GPUs using distributed stencil computations on GPUs and recent development of GPU-ready automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities. We plan to focus on conciseness and efficiency using the [ParallelStencil.jl](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl), [ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl) and [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) Julia packages as tools.\r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of 2 parts:\r\n1. You will learn about parallel and distributed GPU computing and iterative solvers.\r\n2. You will implement a PDE constrained optimisation on GPUs.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this workshop, you will:\r\n- Have a GPU PDE solver that predicts ice flow and an AD-powered inverse solver to calibrate the forward model;\r\n- Have a Julia code that achieves similar performance to legacy C, CUDA, MPI code or outperforms it;\r\n- Know how the Julia language solves the \"two-language problem\";\r\n- Be able to leverage the computing power of modern GPU accelerated servers and supercomputers.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to having you on board and will make sure to foster exchange of ideas and knowledge to provide an as inclusive as possible event.\r\n\r\nCo-authors: Ivan Utkin\u00b9 \u00b2, Samuel Omlin\u00b9\r\n\r\n\u00b9 ETH Zurich | \u00b2 Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL)", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 4202, "code": "ZTATFJ", "public_name": "Ludovic R\u00e4ss", "biography": "GPU computing and geo-HPC.

We will guide users through the specifics of how they can then begin to develop their own advanced features utilizing the dependent package ModelingToolkit.jl.", "description": "The lumped-parameter model (also called lumped-element model) simplifies the description of the behavior of spatially distributed physical systems, such as electrical circuits, into a topology consisting of discrete entities that approximate the behavior of the distributed system under certain assumptions. It is useful in electrical systems (including electronics), mechanical multi-body systems, heat transfer, acoustics and circulatory mechanics.\r\n\r\nOur focus in this workshop will will be on the dynamics of the circulatory system, or cardio-vascular system. Within the realm of circulatory system mechanics, lumped parameter (0D) modelling offers the unique ability to examine both cardiac function and global hemodynamics within the context of a single model. Due to the interconnected nature of the cardiovascular system, being able to quantify both is crucial for the effective prediction and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Lumped parameter modelling derives one of its main strengths from the minimal computation time required to solve ODEs and algebraic equations. Furthermore, the relatively simple structure of the model allows most personalized simulations to be automated. Meaning the ability to embed these lumped parameter models into a clinical workflow could one day become trivial.\r\n\r\nCirculatorySystemModels.jl is an acausal modelling library, built on top of ModelingToolkit.jl and the SciML ecosystem. This tight integration means that once the model is set up, global optimization, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, ..., are just a few lines of code away. And due to the speed of Julia, even high-dimensional parameter models become feasible for a high-abstraction level modeling system.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will introduce CirculatorySystemModels.jl in a hands on fashion. We will walk users through the fundamentals of acausal modelling, and will then demonstrate how we can build up complex cardio-vascular network from simple elements in a \"if you can draw it, you can model it paradigm\" by simply connecting the individual components. We will then use the power of ModelingToolkit.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl, and other packagers in the SciML ecosystem to show how the created models can be fed into the wider analysis framework.\r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate how new models/elements can be implemented. We will then take the user through the event handling feature within ModelingToolkit to demonstrate how we can recreate complex physiological components which open a new era of modelling which other platforms can't support. In the second half of the workshop we will focus on model analysis and demonstrate how our pre-built circulation models can be used within relevant research. The participants will leave with a clear understanding of how to use the Julia package ecosystem to efficiently handle these difficult circulation models, and will have a new perspective for understanding the model analysis advances made by Julia in recent years.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26242, "code": "LBMXCW", "public_name": "Torsten Schenkel", "biography": "Torsten Schenkel is a theoretical engineer.

But the expectations are often being disappointed as soon as one tries to adapt this concept for real life use cases. Bad convergence behavior, handling of discontinuities and/or instabilities are just some of the stumbling blocks that might pop up during the first steps. During the workshop, we want to show how to integrate real life industrial models in NeuralODEs using FMI and present sophisticated training strategies.", "description": "Despite the great potential of NeuralODEs - the structural combination of an artifical neural network and an ODE solver - they are not yet a standard tool in modeling of physical systems. We believe, there are mainly two reasons for that: First, NeuralODEs develop their full potential if paired with existing models that capture some basic physics. However, existing models typically are set up in dedicated simulation tools and thus not available in Julia. Second, training of NeuralODEs is tricky and not yet plug and play. In this tutorial, we share methods to employ models from various simulation tools in NeuralODEs and training strategies that can deal with challenges of industrial scale. Both was validated in real examples ranging from automotive to medical use cases.\r\nFor us, one of the key challenges to make the jump from science to application, was to allow the re-use of existing simulation models from common modeling tools as parts of NeuralODEs. For this purpose, we picked the model exchange format FMI (https://fmi-standard.org/), which can be understood as a container format for ODEs and is supported by more than 170 simulation tools. Using our Julia package FMI.jl it is possible to handle FMUs \u2013 that\u2019s how models compliant with FMI are called \u2013 in Julia. Further, the package connects FMUs to the common automatic differentiation packages in Julia. The library FMIFlux.jl enables the use of FMUs in machine learning applications. Using both allows for the following workflow:\r\n(1) Export your model from your favorite simulation tool as FMU, \r\n(2) Import the FMU in Julia, \r\n(3) Use the FMU as layer of an ANN in Julia, \r\n(4) Train the resulting NeuralODE, called NeuralFMU. \r\nUnfortunately, the fourth step is more complicated than it looks at first glance. NeuralFMUs or NeuralODEs in general tend to exhibit expensive gradient computation and thus very long training times. Further, they tend to converge to local minima or enter unstable regions. In order to cope with these challenges, we present strategies to\r\n\u2022\tdesign a target-oriented topology for such a model\r\n\u2022\tinitialize or even pre-train such models\r\n\u2022\tdeal with large data and use batching\r\n\u2022\tefficiently train such multi-domain models \r\n\r\nEquipped with knowledge about typical pitfalls and their workarounds, workshop participants will have an easier time dealing with their own NeuralODE applications.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26269, "code": "PWQVZG", "public_name": "Tobias Thummerer", "biography": "Research Scientist @ University of Augsburg", "answers": []}, {"id": 27882, "code": "DML9DB", "public_name": "Lars Mikelsons", "biography": "Professor at the chair for mechatronics at the University of Augsburg", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}], "32-144": [{"id": 26971, "guid": "f931dbce-edca-5203-8324-022440fd4203", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-25T09:00:00-04:00", "start": "09:00", "duration": "03:00", "room": "32-144", "slug": "juliacon2023-26971-building-rest-apis-with-julia", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/BX3MYR/", "title": "Building REST APIs with Julia", "subtitle": "", "track": "JuliaCon", "type": "Workshop", "language": "en", "abstract": "Although Julia is a growing, fast language with relatively easy syntax, and thus quite a productive language, its popularity still seems enormously lopsided towards the scientific community.

They rely on scientific computing to analyze and understand complex and dynamic systems. We present WorldDynamics.jl, an open-source Julia package that allows the development and reproduction of IAMs using modern scientific computing techniques. In this workshop, we are going to interactively demonstrate the main functionalities of WorldDynamics.jl to the Julia community while guiding the audience with comprehensive hands-on examples.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the package reproduces the whole family of system dynamics models, from Jay Forrester's WORLD1 to the recent Earth4All, including the notable WORLD3, which was reimplemented directly from the DYNAMO code to Julia. Using the ModelingToolkit structure, each model is treated as a collection of subsystems, which are self-contained ODESytem with their own parameters, variables, and equations. All subsystems are connected into a single system, which forms the complete model, with interactions represented as a system of differential equations and solved using DifferentialEquations.jl and ModelingToolkit.jl. This modular structure allows us to play with subsystems individually and combine them in different ways into a unique model with little effort. Besides the original models, it is also straightforward to add existing updated versions as an extension, which exemplifies how a user is able to create their own update from a well-known model.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we are going to present the package functionalities with hands-on examples using several of the currently available models. Initially, we start with a general explanation of the package, emphasizing how it is being developed. Subsequently, we proceed with the major demonstration of the package's main features via practical coding cases, including the reproduction of the original figures from implemented historical models using PlotJS.jl. We also show how to alter the values of parameters, tables, and edit equations of models, leveraging the package modular approach to combine different subsystems in ways that were not easily achievable previously. Finally, we present the development roadmap, which includes current works under construction, our expectations for the near future, and what we intend to achieve in the next major releases.\r\n\r\nAfter the workshop, we expect the audience will be able to have a clear comprehension of current WorldDynamics.jl capabilities and functionalities.

The computational burden imposed by simulating such large-scale models, however, is frequently found to render a range of scientific and engineering tasks like design, control or uncertainty quantification prohibitively expensive. To recover the tractability of such tasks in this setting, it is customary to build a compact, cheap-to-evaluate proxy for the original large-scale model which captures its dominant behaviors accurately, i.e, a reduced order model. And while there exists a wide range of systematic techniques to build such reduced order models, it typically remains a tedious, error-prone and often ad hoc process that frequently requires substantial intrusion into the original model. With ModelOrderReduction.jl we set out to streamline and largely automate this process, keeping active intrusion into the model by the user to a minimum. To that end, we rely on a symbolic representation of the original model specified via ModelingToolkit.jl. The reduction task is then performed on the symbolic representation using the tools provided by Symbolics.jl.  \r\n\r\nFor those who are non-technical, we will discuss how this approach fits into the paradigm of symbolic-numeric computing and as such  applies automatic code transformations beyond automatic differentiation that benefit greatly from the features of the Julia programming language.\r\n    \r\nFor modelers, we will show with scientific PDE and ODE models from the realms of chemical engineering and neuroscience how ModelOrderReduction.jl can help you reduce your models and speed up your computations.\r\n\r\nFor those who are technical, we will dive into greater mathematical detail about the model order reduction techniques that are supported in ModelOrderReduction.jl and why they lend themselves to being automated by way of symbolic computation.

Based on the popular Python library ignite, Ignite.jl provides a high-level, flexible event-based approach for training and evaluating neural networks in Julia with flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe traditional way of training a neural network typically involves using for/while loops and callback functions. However, this approach can become complex and difficult to maintain as the number of events increases and the training pipeline becomes more intricate. Ignite.jl addresses this issue by providing a simple yet flexible engine and event system that allows for the easy composition of training pipelines with various events such as artifact saving, metric logging, and model validation.\r\n\r\nEvent-based training abstracts away the traditional training loop, replacing it with:\r\n1. a training engine which executes a single training step,\r\n2. a data loader iterator which provides data batches, and\r\n3. events and corresponding handlers which are attached to the engine and are configured to fire at specific points during training.\r\n\r\nEvent handlers are much more flexible compared to other approaches like callbacks: they can be any callable, multiple handlers can be attached to a single event, multiple events can trigger the same handler, and custom events can be defined to fire at user-specified points during training. This makes adding functionality to your training pipeline easy, minimizing the need to modify existing code.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the benefits of using Ignite.jl, we provide a minimal working example in the README.md file that demonstrates how to train a simple neural network while periodically logging evaluation metrics. In particular, we highlight that periodic model and optimizer saving can be added with no changes to the rest of the training pipeline \u2013 simply add another event. This example illustrates the benefits of separating the training step from the training loop, and how to simple it is to customize the training pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Ignite.jl is a simple and flexible package that improves the process of training neural networks by using events and handlers. It allows for easy modifications to training pipelines without needing to change existing code, it is well-documented, and thoroughly tested.

This talk describes a real-time cloud-based financial data streaming and storage system implemented in Julia.", "description": "This section will introduce our process for selecting cloud service providers and data sources, compare various system backend implementations, and conclude with a system evaluation. \r\n\r\n**Reasons for AWS cloud**\r\n\r\nInitially, we deployed our program on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud because it offers scalable data storage and can handle concurrent requests from multiple customers/agents. Among the leading cloud service providers (such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud), AWS is currently the market leader and provides one-third of the world's cloud infrastructure services.\r\n\r\n**Data Source**\r\n\r\nWe chose [Polygon](https://polygon.io/) as the data source for our data feed, and particularly, their WebSocket data feed mechanism. Polygon is a leading financial market data platform that supplies market data for stocks, options, futures, and cryptocurrencies. Their aggregated data have up to a second resolution. \r\n\r\n**Key implementation**\r\n\r\nThe backend, the main part of this talk, was implemented in Julia using existing packages. We explored two ways to do this; the first is to use various AWS services via [AWS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl), [LambdaMaker.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/LambdaMaker.jl), etc. Those packages provide different microservices to build up our system. The second approach was to set up EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) instances and deploy the program to these instances. The first approach was the easiest to develop but strongly depended on AWS solutions. For example, we used DynamoDb (an AWS NoSQL database service) to store real-time market data for certain tickers. However, if Amazon shuts down DynamoDb or migrates to another service, we must make changes accordingly. Hence the second approach is not constrained by particular Amazon services;  it requires virtual machines to be configured by users and does not lead to vendor lock-in issues.\r\n\r\nAs for the frontend, we display real-time data from the data source. This component was constructed as a Typescript React App.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram describes how the frontend client/user interacts with the backend AWS services.\r\n\r\n**Evaluations**\r\n\r\nWe considered several key factors when evaluating the real-time data storage system: latency, scalability, accuracy, reliability, and throughput. Of these, scalability and throughput may be influenced by our choice of cloud service. We have preliminary implemented the first backend using AWS solutions, and the frontend is a React application deployed on AWS Amplify service. The frontend does not have a limit on concurrency but has some constraints such as total data transfer, request duration, and the total number of requests in the free tier. We will be able to determine which one reaches the limit first after building the frontend features. Our backend service DynamoDB has limitations on concurrency, which is 25 read requests per second. If we consider each request of historical data requires one read from the database, our free tier supports a maximum of 25 concurrent requests at the same time.\r\n\r\nLatency can be measured in various ways, including end-to-end latency and processing latency. End-to-end latency measures the time taken from a request to be made to a response to be received. In this scenario, it measures the data processing time from start to finish for a given ticker. We have implemented the backend with various AWS solutions, and despite some spike processing time of up to 2,000ms to 4,000ms, the average data processing time is now 100-200ms. Processing latency, on the other hand, measures the time it takes for the system to process a specific input or request. In this scenario, it measures the steps of backend data processing: storing a ticker data in the database and notifying the client in real-time. The average processing time for storing a ticker data is 30ms to 100ms, while notifying the client in real-time is 70ms to 120ms. We will also be able to evaluate the \"real-time\" performance of our system using these two different backend implementations once the second implementation is completed.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of our system, we need to consistently provide correct and current data in an optimized way, especially in the face of client changes or malicious attacks. Our backend system should be able to handle and optimize for these scenarios without being affected.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26345, "code": "NBA3LP", "public_name": "Ruize Ren", "biography": null, "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 24317, "guid": "aefc09d7-c4fb-5c57-8dad-c89ffd44c350", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-25T14:55:00-04:00", "start": "14:55", "duration": "00:30", "room": "Pre-Recorded Talks", "slug": "juliacon2023-24317-pipelines-jobschedulers-for-computational-workflow-development", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/ZCNXEB/", "title": "Pipelines & JobSchedulers for computational workflow development", "subtitle": "", "track": "HPC", "type": "Online Only Talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Computational workflows and pipelines are essential in large-scale data analysis and bioinformatics.

The approach addresses optimal long-term water supply infrastructure planning with constraints feasibility at operational timescales. We combine an outer primal decomposition of planning stages and inner dual ones of operating scenarios, with convexified non-anticipative constraints relaxed for scenarios.", "description": "The efficient operation of a series of critical infrastructures such as water networks is essential to sustainable futures. However, to sustain good infrastructure services in many places, they need continuous expansion, mainly in response to population growth and rapid industrialization. As a specific example, consider a water supply network that supplies the required demand of different consumers using the available resources. However, for the smooth operation of the network, it is necessary to find new resources and connect them to the growing demand points in an economical manner. If this expansion planning is to be done for a long-term horizon, it requires considering uncertainties on various system parameters like demands, price of electricity, and availability of resources. These conditions also are similar to a great extent for the other infrastructure networks like electric power, gas, and district heating networks with their related equations, variables, and parameters. As a result, long-term infrastructure planning problems that confront high levels of uncertainty need an appropriate approach to modeling this process. For this purpose, multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) can be used as a well-established approach for dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. However, due to the nonlinear equation governing the operation of physical infrastructure networks, besides the mixed-integer nature of planning decision variables, this becomes a complicated non-convex problem. In this regard, an iterative procedure based on primal-dual decomposition and convex relaxation for solving this MSSP problem is put forward. This technique is motivated by explained planning problem that requires the satisfaction of constraints that describe operational processes for water supply infrastructure at multiple timescales. Since the aim is just finding a dual for the operation problem (pump scheduling or optimal power flow), each approach, like copositive programming, that can do this task can be used for this purpose. Here, applying a dual decomposition technique, e.g., optimality condition decomposition or Lagrangian relaxation, breaks the time dependency of intra-operation intervals. It also makes amenable the operation of the system in a decentralized mode by relaxing the coupling constraints like mass conservation and nodal power balance equations. If the operation problems are considered the subproblems (second-stage), their solving generates relative cuts for the master planning problem (first-stage problem). This procedure will terminate with the convergence of outer primal decomposition to an acceptable gap. Figure 2 represents the primal\\dual decomposition of the scenario tree Figure 1 in two steps. Flowchart 3 also shows the proposed solution technique graphically. The packages for solving the SP in the Julia programming language have been reviewed in Table 1. It is clear from this table that there is not any package to tackle the non-convex nonlinear mixed-integer MSSP problem. This work aims to develop a solver for this complicated MSSP problem. It also must be mentioned that although the proposed approach is applied to water supply networks, it is general enough to be used for any infrastructure network.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26336, "code": "TYMAXM", "public_name": "Alireza Shefaei", "biography": "He received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University (ASMU), Tabriz, Iran, in 2014.

It aims to solve the problem where you might be reluctant to take on a package as a dependency just to extend a function to a type in that package due to e.g. increased load time of the package.", "description": "The multiple dispatch paradigm of Julia makes it very easy to extend functionality to new types. A package can just define a new method of a generic function that accepts a type in another package, and anyone that calls that function with that type will get the extended behavior. An example of this could be a plotting package that extends a plotting method to various types in the Julia ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, to extend a method with a type from another package, one needs to make that package a dependency. This has a cost, most noticeably in package load time. This means that for a package author, there is always a conflict between wanting to provide useful method extensions and keeping the load time of the package small.\r\n\r\nThe go-to solution for the problem above has been the Requires.jl package. In Requires.jl one defines a piece of code that gets automatically executed when another package is loaded. This code typically adds some extra method for one of the types in the package. Since you are not directly depending on the package, you no longer unconditionally pay the loading cost of it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Requires.jl comes with some drawbacks:\r\n- The code that gets executed when a package gets loaded is `eval`-ed into the module which means that that code can not be precompiled, leading to worse latency.\r\n- It is not possible to set any compatibility constraints on the packages triggering the\r\n- Requires.jl had issues with PackageCompiler since it needed access to files during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe new [\"package extension\"](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Conditional-loading-of-code-in-packages-(Extensions)) functionality in 1.9 is meant to fully replace the usage of Requires.jl while solving the issues mentioned above.

Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the learned models enclose an **explicit knowledge representation**, which offers many opportunities:\r\n\r\n- Verifying that the model's thought process is adequate for a given task;\r\n- Learning of new insights by simple inspection of the model;\r\n- Manual refinement of the model at a later time.\r\n\r\nThese levels of **transparency** (or *interpretability*) are generally not available with standard machine learning methods, thus, as AI permeates more and more aspects of our lives, symbolic learning is becoming increasingly popular. In spite of this, implementations of symbolic algorithms (e.g, extraction of decision trees or rules) are mostly scattered across different languages and machine learning frameworks.\r\n\r\n*Enough with this!* The lesser and lesser minoritarian theory of symbolic learning deserves a programming framework of its own. So, here comes [Sole.jl](https://bit.ly/3X5pQUJ), a collection of Julia packages for symbolic learning and reasoning; Sole.jl covers **a relatively wide range of functionality** that is of interest for the symbolic community, but it also fills some gaps with a few functionalities for standard machine learning pipelines (e.g., feature selection on multimodal (un)structured data). At the time of writing, the framework comprehends the following packages:\r\n\r\n+ [SoleLogics.jl](https://bit.ly/3QwLRJF) lays the **logical foundations** for symbolic learning. It provides a useful codebase for [*computational logic*](https://bit.ly/3ZOzs8a), which features easy manipulation of:\r\n\t+ Propositional and (multi)modal logics (propositions, logical constants, alphabet, grammars, fuzzy algebras);\r\n\t+ [Logical formulas](https://bit.ly/3w5tNgf) (random generation, parsing, minimization);\r\n\t+ [Logical interpretations](https://bit.ly/3w5t26M) (or models, e.g., [Kripke structures](https://bit.ly/3XbLXcc));\r\n\t+ Algorithms for [model checking](https://bit.ly/3kgAoSj) (that is, checking that a formula is satisfied by an interpretation).\r\n+ [SoleData.jl](https://bit.ly/3GYh4SF) provides a **data layer** built on top DataFrames.jl/Tables.jl. Its codebase is machine learning oriented and allows to:\r\n\t+ Instantiate and manipulate [*multimodal*](https://bit.ly/3J7TCEj) datasets for (un)supervised machine learning;\r\n\t+ Deal with [*(un)structured* data](https://bit.ly/3ILl7mN) (e.g., graphs, images, time-series, etc.);\r\n\t+ Describe datasets via basic statistical measures;\r\n\t+ Save to/load from *npy/npz* format, as well as a custom CSV-based format (with interesting features such as *lazy loading* of datasets);\r\n\t+ Perform basic data processing operations (e.g., windowing, moving average, etc.).\r\n+ [SoleFeatures.jl](https://bit.ly/3GVDNPj) provides tools for filter-based **feature selection** on [*(un)structured* data](https://bit.ly/3ILl7mN). At this time, the package provides:\r\n\t+ 3 native feature selection methods, plus a wrapper around python implementations from *scikit-learn* and *scikit-feature*;\r\n\t+ Generalized feature selection methods that also apply to dimensional data (e.g., images or time-series), via a step of window-based flattening;\r\n\t+ Specific methods for time-series feature selection, based on [Catch22.jl](https://github.com/brendanjohnharris/Catch22.jl/);\r\n\t+ An easily extendible codebase, with abstraction layers similar to those of *scikit-learn*.\r\n+ [SoleModels.jl](https://bit.ly/3GVDPqp) defines the building blocks of **symbolic modeling and learning**. It is the core of the framework, and it features:\r\n\t+ Definitions for symbolic models (decision trees/forests, rules, etc.);\r\n\t+ Optimized data structures, useful when learning models from datasets;\r\n\t+ Support for mixed, neuro-symbolic computation.\r\n+ [SolePostHoc.jl](https://bit.ly/3QAIL7b) provides some tools for **analyzing and post-processing the learned symbolic models**. It features:\r\n\t+ Tools for inspecting and simplifying the models;\r\n\t+ Rule extraction from decision forests;\r\n\t+ Feature importance estimation.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Sole.jl makes for a powerful tool built with an eye to **formal correctness**, and is of use for both machine learning practitioners and computational logicians.\r\n\r\n**Q:** Ok, so what symbolic learning methods do you people provide?\r\n**A:** At the moment, [ModalDecisionTrees.jl](https://bit.ly/3w20Fqj) is the only package compatible with Sole.jl, and it provides novel decision tree algorithms based on multimodal temporal and spatial logics for time-series and image classification.

This feature (which most solvers lack) truly allows the solvers to be used as sub-routines to other algorithms. The traditional `solve()` interface is also available.\r\n\r\nSince `v0.1`, we have implemented a stricter line-search algorithm. In addition to the existing Armijo method, this Wolfe-like procedure uses left and right-derivative information for the step-size selection. A more accurate line-search results in a higher rate of convergence, at the expense of the added derivative evaluations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have added support for problems with simplex constraints (\u03a3 x_j = 1). This is achieved with a transformation of variables at each iteration. The added constraint is effectively handled by a modified line-search, while ensuring feasibility at every iteration.\r\n\r\nProgradio's early-termination and feasibility capabilities are attractive for infinite-dimensional optimization, such as solving optimal control problems.\r\n\r\nWe give examples of how dynamic optimization packages in our JuDO-dev organization call Progradio's solvers as sub-routines.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 18372, "code": "9AMMJ7", "public_name": "Eduardo M.

This is one of the easiest and less memory-consumption inflow generators method. The package SEMJulia.jl implements the SEM and recreates a statistically correct and coherent turbulent flow.", "description": "The generation of inflow data for spatially developing turbulent flows is one of the challenges that must be addressed prior to the application of LES to industrial flows and complex geometries. The specification of realistic inlet boundary conditions is widely acknowledged to play a significant role in the accuracy of a numerical simulation. Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach needs only mean profiles for the velocity and turbulence variables, making the definition of inflow data relatively simple but the results less accurate. The generation of inflow data is much more difficult in large-eddy and direct-numerical simulations. The SEM has to be adequately tuned in order to be dependent on the turbulent intensity and to trigger the transitions to turbulence over the tested geometries in order to reproduce the experimental data. It is not advisable to use a generic white noise for creating turbulence mostly because it generates incredibly high local gradients and so the turbulence is going to be completely dissipated. \r\nThis package in a few lines allows the user to obtain a time-dependent statistically correct and coherent turbulent flow. The problem is initialized by the user setting the dimension of the inlet, the mesh size and turbulence intensity.\r\nIn the program logic, the eddies, which are coherent fluid structures, resembling the concept of vortex, are generated in a \"virtual box\". This is a computational domain placed in such a way that the surface of the inlet is contained within it. In this environment, eddies are just translated, and the properties of the flow are computed on the inlet surface. \r\nThe instantaneous flow field is saved in a cache object and is updated when the user wants to advance of one time-step. Due to the customizable size of the \"virtual box\", is it possible to use this package also in case of curved surfaces. \r\nThe flow properties are computed only on the points of the inlet surface. Each eddy is characterised by a single coordinate set defining the centre and an intensity level (+1, -1).\r\nThe creation of synthetic eddies relies upon mathematical and statistical definitions. More advanced users can also select between different mathematical functions adopted to generate the eddies (at the moment just the tent and gaussian, more can be easily coded).\r\nIt has been realized in Julia because at the moment of the development such a method was implemented only in other programming languages. In comparison with other similar projects (in Python or Fortran), there is less code and the use is straightforward. Furthermore, it is really close to the mathematical notation and it makes it easier to understand by future contributors.\r\nFinally, the results of the package have been tested. The spectral analysis shows that the flow field generated shows the expected turbulence characteristics. The final achievement will be to couple the turbulence generation with the FEM solver for incompressible flows.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this package can be widely adopted in the field of fluid dynamics for obtaining more realistic and accurate results.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 25228, "code": "GWEBQN", "public_name": "Carlo Brunelli", "biography": "PhD student in computational fluid dynamics.\r\nAreas of interest:\r\n- Julia (of course)\r\n- Finite Element Method for fluid-dynamics\r\n- Variational Multiscale Method for incompressible fluids", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 25060, "guid": "0713ff6b-8913-560b-9662-df571c202362", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-26T14:40:00-04:00", "start": "14:40", "duration": "00:10", "room": "32-123", "slug": "juliacon2023-25060-the-new-xgboost-wrapper", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/RBKKSS/", "title": "the new XGBoost wrapper", "subtitle": "", "track": "JuliaCon", "type": "Lightning talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Gradient boosted trees are a wonderfully flexible tool for machine learning and XGBoost is a state-of-the-art, widely used C++ implementation.

To assemble a voice assistant, it is sufficient to define a dictionary with command names as keys and objects representing actions as values. Objects of type `Cmd`, for example, will automatically open the corresponding application. To define application-specific commands - a key feature for voice assistants - a command dictionary can simply be tied to the `Cmd`-object triggering the application.", "description": "Creating a feature-complete voice assistant for desktop computing is practically impossible, because it would mean to support any possible software that exists, including every tiny application written by individuals. Moreover, the way computers are used varies strongly from one user to the other, making personalizability indispensable for voice assistants. We address these challenges by empowering the users themselves to quickly assemble the voice assistant they desire.\r\n\r\n[JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) enables to quickly assemble fully personalized voice assistants. One solely needs to define a normal Julia dictionary with command names as keys and objects representing actions as values. The object type determines the kind of action that will be taken at runtime. For example, if the object is a `Function`, then it will be called; if it is a `Tuple` of keyboard keys representing a keyboard shortcut, then the keys will be pressed; and if it is a `Cmd`, then the corresponding application will be opened. Furthermore, the object can also be an array of action objects, representing a sequence of commands. In addition, it is trivial to define application-specific commands, which is key to effective voice control: it is sufficient to create a dictionary with the application-specific commands and tie it to the `Cmd`-object triggering the application. [JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) will then automatically take care of activating the application-specific commands when the application is opened, and deactivating them again as soon as another application is opened. The activation and deactivation of commands requires adaption with respect to the speech recognizers used and the transition between them is a challenge when required within a contiguously spoken word group; [JustSayIt.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayIt.jl) solves this challenge by dynamically generating those recognizers in function of the word group context, when beneficial for recognition accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe action-semantics that is associated to the object types in the command dictionaries combined with the possibility to define command sequences on-the-fly and application-specific commands without effort results in an unprecedented, highly expressive and effective way to assemble personalized voice assistants. Naturally, it is trivial to share the command dictionaries defining the assembly of a voice assistant and the [JustSayItRecipes.jl](https://github.com/omlins/JustSayItRecipes.jl) repository provides a platform for it.

Space-partitioning data structures are vital for algorithms that exploit spatial distance to reduce computational complexity, see for example the Fast Multipole Method and Nearest Neighbors.", "description": "# Model\r\nAssuming a set of `n` points `V` in a `d`-dimensional space, we partition the space into regular hierarchical bins. The resulting data structure is a sparse tree `T` with, at most, `2^d` child nodes per node and a maximum depth of `L`.\r\n\r\n## Normalization\r\nThe given set of points `V` is mapped into a `d`-dimensional unit hypercube via an affine transformation that scales and translates `V` resulting in `Vn`.\r\n\r\n## Binning\r\nWe split each dimension of the unit hypercube in half and recursively continue splitting each resulting hypercube in the same manner. Each partition is called a bin. The subdivision stops at a maximum depth `L` or when a bin contains `k` or fewer points. The recursive splitting process is recorded as a hierarchical tree data structure.\r\n\r\n## 1D Encoding\r\nWe use Morton encoding to map the `d`-dimensional set `Vn` to a one-dimensional space-filling curve. Each point in `Vn` is assigned an index in the reduced space resulting in `R`. Elements of `R` are bit-fields, each one consisting of `L` groups of `d` bits. These groups describe the position of the point in the corresponding level of the tree `T`. Points described by morton indices with equal most signifficant digits belong in the same bin. Thus, sorting `R` results in `Rs` which defines the sparse tree.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nCache-locality and parallel programming are some of the techniques we used, to make our implementation performant.\r\n\r\n## Cache locality\r\nCache locality offers fast memory access that greatly improves the performance of our algorithm.\r\n\r\n- The set of points `V`, and by extension `Vn`, is defined as a `Matrix` of size `(d, n)`. The leading dimension describes the number of dimensions in the hyperspace resulting in an access pattern that is more friendly to the cache since all points of `V` have their corresponding coordinates densely packed in memory.\r\n\r\n- Sorting `R` and `Vn` offers a memory layout that is cache-friendly. Since we access `V` through the `T` tree, we only access points that are in the same bin. `Rs` describes a bin of `T` with a contiguous block of memory, thus preserving cache-locality.\r\n\r\n- `T` is not a linked-tree. `T` is a tree stored densely in memory as a `Vector{Node}`. Each `Node` of `T` is aware of their children and parent using their indices in this dense `Vector{Node}`.\r\n\r\n## Parallel Partial Sorting\r\nThe Morton curve bit-field denotes the tree node of each point. The partial sorting using the Most Significant Digit (MSD) radix-sort, places the points to the corresponding bins. Points that fall within the same leaf node do not get sorted. The radix-sort runs in parallel: the partition of digits is done with a parallel count-sort, and then each digit subset is processed independently in parallel.\r\n\r\n## Adaptive Tree\r\nEmpty bins, that is, nodes that do not contain any points, are not stored or referenced explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- Sun, X., & Pitsianis, N.

The entire process relies on simulation. We developed a novel workflow that improved productivity by using the outstanding adaptability of the Julia language and its ecosystem. We could adapt a validated simulator to test and verify all the AOCS algorithms at each development phase, drastically reducing error propagation and, consequently, test cost", "description": "The satellite attitude is defined as its orientation in space. Most satellites require attitude control to point their payloads to acquire the data. The satellite subsystem in charge of estimating and controlling the attitude is the attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS). When this subsystem can also maintain the satellite orbit, it is called the attitude and orbit control subsystem (AOCS).\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to reliably reproduce the space rigid-body dynamics on the ground. Hence, the development of the AOCS highly depends on simulation from the design phase up to the acceptance tests. This specificity leads to an \"n-simulator\" problem, where each development phase requires constructing some simulation tool. For example, when developing and tuning the control loop, the specialist must use a minimal dynamics simulation to verify the control law. In a more advanced phase, when the embedded software is being coded, the software engineer should also use a simulator to perform closed-loop tests to check whether the control laws are correctly implemented.\r\n\r\nGiven all the difficulties that arise from keeping all those simulators, the AOCS development usually happens through unit tests and simple scenarios. However, unit tests can hardly verify the entire AOCS algorithms, for it depends on Markov chains. Thus, more than a simple input/output verification is needed, and a vast number of internal states must be taken into account. Deeper tests only occur with the onboard computer in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation when everything is implemented. Even though this approach usually simplifies the simulation requirements, some errors can only be spotted late, leading to significant problems for the project. One of them is the time required for algorithm testing and debugging using real hardware. Those are expensive tests since they happen in real-time, leading to a significant mobilization of the test team and the use of expensive flight hardware.\r\n\r\nPreviously, using the packages SatelliteToolbox.jl, ReferenceFrameRotations.jl, and DifferentialEquations.jl, we managed to create high fidelity simulator for the Brazilian Multi-Mission Platform (PMM, in Portuguese), called PmmAocsSimulator.jl. We validated this tool using on-orbit data from the Amazonia-1 satellite.\r\n\r\nFor our next AOCS generation, we want to rely on the validated simulator code for all the development phases. The algorithms for the embedded software are initially constructed in Julia inside the PmmAocsSimulator.jl. When the control engineer validates the dynamics, the Julia code is translated to C++ using the CxxWrap.jl package, which is also run inside the same environment. Afterward, the same C++ code is compiled for the onboard processor and run in its emulator. In this phase, the onboard software is also tested in a closed-loop environment using the PmmAocsSimulator.jl. Lastly, the AOCS software is integrated with the rest of the satellite computer software, and a final simulation takes place using the real onboard computer.\r\n\r\nSince all the phases are simulated using the same validated environment, the results must be perfectly matched. This workflow allows us to develop the next AOCS generation with a huge gain compared to the classic scenario. The development can happen incrementally but also with a full test suite encompassing the most significant dynamics states of the satellite, which is impossible to reproduce without such an environment. Hence, most of the issues related to attitude control can be spotted and solved by the AOCS team before the final software integration. All this workflow is only possible given the considerable adaptability of the Julia language and the tools available in its ecosystem.\r\n\r\nFinally, the gains obtained by this new workflow are massive. We have already implemented 50% of the AOCS functions for the next-generation software, and we have yet to identify a single algorithm bug at the final test stage with the flight hardware. This process allowed us to drastically reduce the test hours using the real satellite computer, which also helped diminish the development cost.\r\n\r\nThis talk will detail all the processes mentioned before, stating how the Julia language and its ecosystem are being used at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to solve the n-simulator problem by providing one single simulator for all the AOCS development phases.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 10877, "code": "8AFQPZ", "public_name": "Ronan Arraes Jardim Chagas", "biography": "Since 2013, Ronan Arraes Jardim Chagas has been with the Space Systems Division of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE).

Once a model is built, it can be simulated efficiently and fit electrophysiological and neuroimaging data.  Moreover, the circuit behavior of multiple model variants can be investigated to aid in distinguishing between competing hypotheses.\r\nWe employ ModelingToolkit.jl to describe the dynamical behavior of blox as symbolic (stochastic/delay) differential equations.  Our libraries of modular blox consist of individual neurons (Hodgkin-Huxley, IF, QIF, LIF, etc.), neural mass models (Jansen-Rit, Wilson-Cowan, Lauter-Breakspear, Next Generation, microcanonical circuits etc.) and biomimetically-constrained control circuit elements.  A GUI designed to be intuitive to neuroscientists allows researchers to build models that automatically generate high-performance systems of numerical ordinary/stochastic differential equations from which one can run stimulations with parameters fit to experimental data.  Our benchmarks show that the increase in speed for simulation often exceeds a factor of 100 as compared to neural mass model implementation by the Virtual Brain (python) and similar packages in MATLAB.  For parameter fitting of brain circuit dynamical models, we use Turing.jl to perform probabilistic modeling, including Hamilton-Monte-Carlo sampling and Automated Differentiation Variational Inference.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate Neuroblox.jl by building small dynamic brain circuits.  We construct circuits by first defining the nodes (\u201cblox\u201d) and then either defining an adjacency matrix, building directed graphs, or sketching the circuit in our GUI to assemble the brain circuit ODE systems.  Using symbolic equations through ModelingToolkit.jl allows us to define additional parameters of the system that are varied across the system, which later can be used for parameter fitting of data.  We will also demonstrate the simulation of networks of several hundred spiking neurons representing a biomimetic reinforcement learning model.  We present visual patterns to these spiking neuron networks and apply a learning algorithm to adjust the weights to classify the different patterns.  The reinforcement learning feedback is implemented by frequent callbacks into the ODE system and allows us to monitor the learning rate continuously.  In addition, we will show examples of a larger brain circuit generating an emergent systems-level cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop, which selectively responds to learned visual patterns and matches many of the experimental data's dynamic behaviors from non-human primates.

Historically, jump processes have been developed in the context of dynamical systems with the objective of describing dynamics with discrete jumps. In contrast, the development of point processes has been more focused in describing the occurrence of random events. In this talk we bridge the gap between the treatment of point and jump process simulation. The algorithms previously included in JumpProcesses.jl can be mapped to three general methods developed in statistics for simulating evolutionary point processes. Our comparative exercise reveals that the library originally lacked an efficient algorithm for simulating processes with variable intensity rates. We therefore extended JumpProcesses.jl with a new simulation algorithm, Coevolve, that enables the rapid simulation of processes with locally-bounded variable intensity rates. It is now poosible to efficiently simulate any point process on the real-line with a non-negative, left-continuous, history-adapted and locally bounded intensity rate.

The capabilities in this layer are what pushed Modelica forward into applications like real-time hardware-in-the-loop because symbolic manipulation provides enormous benefits here that other tools, lacking symbolic manipulation, could not match.  There were some amazing contributions from Pantelides, Elmqvist, Otter, Cellier, and many others in this area and it is important that people understand these advances.\r\n\r\nFinally, you have the language itself.  While the symbolic manipulation opened many doors to extend what was possible with modeling and simulation, the language that was layered on top addressed very important ideas around usability.  It brought in many important ideas from software engineering to make modeling and simulation a scalable enterprise (allowing model developers to create models that had potentially 1000s of components and tens or even hundreds of thousands of equations).  But it also brought usability with a representation that quite naturally and seamlessly allowed graphical, schematic based modeling to be implemented consistently by a number of different tools.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say that Modelica is perfect or that better tools aren't possible.

It is a cornerstone of modern quantum technology: quantum control is how one generates entangled states for quantum sensing, or realizes the logic gates in a quantum computer. Solving the control problem requires numerically simulating the dynamics of the quantum system and then iteratively tuning the control fields to minimize some figure of merit. I will give an overview of the [`QuantumControl.jl` framework](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl), which implements state of the art methods for simulation and optimization.\r\n\r\nJulia provides unique advantages in flexibility and numerical efficiency, both of which are critical to quantum control. Multiple dispatch makes it easy to adapt to different physical systems and efficient representations.

These relationships are often depicted in a tree structure, where internal nodes represent hypothetical ancestral species and external nodes (leaves) represent extant organisms or species. Over the past few decades, though, the importance of biological processes which cannot be represented in a tree structure (such as hybridization, introgression, and more) has become more well-known, which has led to a drastic increase in depicting these relationships with directed networks.\r\n\r\nMany common procedures for estimating such species trees and networks begin by estimating a collection of many gene trees from sequence data. These gene trees can be discordant even if a tree model is sufficient for modeling the species relationship, due to a process called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Thus, one of the main difficulties with model-based approaches is that it is difficult to disentangle what proportion of gene trees are adequately explained by a tree structure and ILS, and what proportion requires a network structure to be explained.\r\n\r\nOur package RANSANEC.jl (RAndom SAmple NEtwork Consensus) implements the classical statistical method of RANSAC (RAndom SAmple Consensus) in phylogenetic tree-space in order to separate the set of estimated gene trees which are adequately explained by ILS and a tree structure and those which require a network structure.

Suppose\r\nthe program runs to completion, but it has many NaNs (\"not a number\"\r\nin IEEE floating-point arithmetic) in the result.\r\n\r\nUnable to proceed meaningfully, the scientist resorts to printing out\r\nthe NaNs by decoding the values (a hugely time-consuming \"hit-miss\"\r\nproposition). After weeks of work, they discover that one particular\r\ndivision operation within an inner Julia library function J and\r\nanother sqrt() inside a GPU library function G are two sources of\r\nNaNs.\r\n\r\nProbing further, the scientist discovers that function J is called\r\nalong two call paths P1 and P2. Path P1 conducts the NaN generated by\r\nfunction J to the output result. Path P2, on the other hand, goes\r\nthrough a Julia less-than (<) function that \"kills\" the NaN by\r\nsilently consuming it in the computation.\r\n\r\nThe scientist decides to rewrite this function to conduct the NaN to\r\nthe output (call it \"failure manifestation\" for debugging), but they\r\nare unsure if there is another call path P3 that also can be activated\r\nunder a different input, and whether P3 might also kill the NaN\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nCurious about why function G generates NaN, the scientist seeks the\r\nCUDA sources for it; unfortunately, they discover that G is supplied\r\nby NVIDIA in binary form with no documentation.\r\n\r\nThe scientist now hears about OUR NEW TOOL FlowFPX---a unique\r\ncontribution that has many attractive features:\r\n\r\n- (a) FlowFPX can run program P unmodified, and shows all the call-paths\r\nthrough the code impinging on functions J and G. Across the thousands\r\nof numerical iterations of code C, FlowFPX summarizes all the paths\r\nthat cause J and G to GENERATE NaNs (gen), the paths that PROPAGATE\r\nNaNs (prop), and paths that KILL the NaNs (kill)---a much more\r\ncomprehensive report that is generated automatically.\r\n\r\n- (b) FlowFPX even produces a nice graphical visualization of gen, prop,\r\nand kill.\r\n\r\n- (c) To find additional lurking paths such as P3, FlowFPX can induce\r\nstress by making any floating-point operator foo() artificially\r\ngenerate NaNs. This simulates an (as yet unseen) input which might\r\nhave caused foo() to spit out a NaN. Using this facility, the\r\nscientist discovers ways to failure-manifest paths in program P paths.\r\n\r\n- (d) The scientist also discovers that FlowFPX comes with a companion\r\ntool called BinFPE that can examine binary-only GPU codes using\r\nNVIDIA-provided binary instrumentation. This way, if G internally\r\ngenerates a NaN but silently kills this NaN inside the code, the\r\nscientist can do one of two things: (i) see if NVIDIA provides an\r\nalternative implementation of G that helps failure-manifest. (ii)\r\nartificially generate a NaN at the return site of the G call even if G\r\nsilently kills the NaN inside. This helps keep the program P more\r\ntransparent and reliable in that internal NaNs are not lost during\r\ntest runs.\r\n\r\nThe scientist then goes and reads the documentation of FlowFPX and\r\nfinds these important facts that further makes them a fan of the\r\nFlowFPX tool:\r\n\r\n- (a) NaN-bugs are not rare.

Our simulator targets researchers and students, offering an easy-to-use GUI.

The results show that Koma can simulate with high accuracy (MAEs below 0.1% compared to JEMRIS) and better GPU performance than MRiLab.", "description": "I-INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations are an important tool for analyzing and developing new acquisition and reconstruction methods in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Simulations allow us to isolate and study phenomena by removing unwanted effects, such as hardware imperfections, and others. Additionally, with the increasing use of Machine Learning models, simulation becomes even more relevant, because it can be used to generate synthetic data for training, or to construct signal dictionaries to infer quantitative measurements from the acquired data. Moreover, simulations are an excellent tool for education and training, as hands-on experience is a great way to assimilate the theoretical and practical components of MRI.\r\n\r\nWe believe an ideal simulator should be general, fast, easy to use, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform. In this work, we developed an MRI simulation framework built from the ground up to satisfy these requirements. We chose the Julia programming language because its syntax is similar to MATLAB (widely used by the MRI community), its excellent GPU support, and its speed is comparable to C/C++. This has been shown to be the case in other MRI applications such as image reconstruction with MRIReco.jl, where the authors achieved speeds on par with state-of-the-art toolboxes.\r\n\r\nWe called our simulator \u201cKoma\u201d, inspired by the Japanese word for spinning top, as its physics resemble MRI\u2019s\r\n\r\nII-METHODS\r\n\r\nKoma simulates the magnetization the spins in a virtual object by solving the Bloch equations. The solution of these equations for a single spin is independent of the state of the other spins in the system, a key feature that enables parallelization. \r\n\r\nOur simulator uses a first-order splitting method to simplify the solution of the Bloch equations. This reflects mathematically the intuition of separating the Bloch equations in a two-step process, rotation and relaxation, for each time step. This method is exact in many common cases in MRI, but in general, has O(dt^3) convergence.\r\n\r\nFor CPU parallelization, we used the macro Threads.@threads, and the package ThreadsX.jl. To ensure thread safety, we stored the acquired signals per thread in different matrices to add them later into a signal matrix. On the other hand, for the GPU support we operated with CuArrays from CUDA.jl.\r\n\r\nWe ensured type stability to enable high performance. Moreover, we had special care to perform in-place operations and not generate unnecessary variable copies using the @view macro in the simulation functions. Finally, we used NVIDIA Nsight Systems to profile GPU performance with the NVTX.@range and CUDA.@profile macros.\r\n\r\nFor the GUI we used Blink.jl, a framework to develop applications using web technologies. The GUI allows the user to easily plot the sequence, \ud835\udc58-space, phantom, acquired signal, and reconstructed images. Plots are done using the PlotlyJS.jl package, which also allows to export them to .svg files.\r\n\r\nTo test the accuracy of our simulator, we compared Koma with the latest version of JEMRIS (v2.9), which has been compared with real MRI acquisitions. On the other hand, we compared the speed of our simulations against MRiLab, an open-source GPU-accelerated MRI simulator. Finally, to compare the ease of use for first-time users, we designed a pilot experience with students of an Imaging course in Engineering, where they learned some fundamentals of MRI.\r\n\r\nIII-RESULTS\t\t\r\n\r\nFor the simulated scenarios we obtained accurate results with MAEs below 0.1% when compared to JEMRIS. When we tested the simulation speed against MRiLab, we found that we had slower CPU performance, but we were 2.6 times faster for the GTX 1650Ti and 6.0 times for the RTX 2080 Ti. \r\n\r\nWe think the CPU results show that we still perform unwanted synchronizations between threads, a problem that our GPU implementation would not suffer as we use Nthreads=1 by default.\r\n\r\nIn the students experience, they reported no problem installing Julia (mean 4.7/5), Koma (mean 4.2/5), JEMRIS (3.8/5), and MRiLab (4.3/5). Regarding the time taken to install each simulator, most of the students were able to install Koma (mean 13.2 min), JEMRIS (mean 33.8 min), and MRiLab (mean 16.9 min) in less than 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nTheir first simulation took them more time in JEMRIS (mean 19 min) and MRiLab (mean 13.9 min) than in Koma (mean 5.7 min). 31% of the students could not simulate on MRiLab (6 students using Mac OS), so we only used Koma and JEMRIS for the rest of the activities.\r\n\r\nTheir reported median simulation speeds were 8.4 times faster with Koma than with JEMRIS, and 65% recommended Koma over JEMRIS.\r\n\r\nIV-CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn this work, we presented a new general MRI simulator programmed in Julia. This simulator is fast, easy to use, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform.

RxInfer.jl unites different Julia packages and forms a user-friendly ecosystem for efficient real-time Bayesian processing of infinite data streams.", "description": "**Background**: Bayesian inference realizes optimal information processing through a full commitment to reasoning by probability theory. The Bayesian framework is positioned at the core of modern AI technology for applications such as speech and image recognition and generation, medical analysis, robot navigation, etc., as it describes how a rational agent ought to update beliefs when new information is revealed by the agent's environment. Unfortunately, perfect Bayesian reasoning is generally intractable, since it requires the calculation of (often) very high-dimensional integrals. As a result, a number of numerical algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference have been developed and implemented in probabilistic programming packages. Successful methods include variants of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, Variational Inference (VI), and Laplace approximation.   \r\n\r\n**Problem statement**: Many important AI applications, such as self-driving vehicles and extended reality video processing, require real-time Bayesian inference. However, sampling-based inference methods do not scale well to realistic probabilistic models with a significant number of latent states. As a result, Monte Carlo sampling-based methods are not suitable for real-time applications. Variational Inference promises to scale better than sampling-based inference, but VI requires derivation of gradients of a \"variational Free Energy\" cost function. For large models, manual derivation of these gradients is not feasible, and automated \"black-box\" gradient methods are too inefficient to be applicable to real-time inference applications. Therefore, while Bayesian inference is known as the optimal data processing framework, in practice, real-time AI applications rely on much simpler, often ad hoc, data processing algorithms. \r\n\r\n**Solution proposal**: We present RxInfer.jl, a package for processing infinite data streams by real-time Bayesian inference in large probabilistic models. RxInfer is open source, available at http://rxinfer.ml, and enjoys the following features:\r\n- A flexible probabilistic model specification. Through Julia macros, RxInfer is capable of automatically transforming a textual description of a probabilistic model to a factor graph representation of that model.\r\n- A flexible inference engine. The inference engine supports a variety of well-known message passing-based inference methods such as belief propagation, structured and mean-field variational message passing, expectation propagation, etc.\r\n- A customized trade-off between accuracy and speed. For each (node and edge) location in the graph, RxInfer enables a custom specification of inference constraints on the variational family of distributions. This enables the use of different Bayesian inference methods at different locations of the graph, leading to an optimized trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity.\r\n- Support for real-time processing of infinite data streams. Since RxInfer is based on a reactive programming framework, implemented by the package Rocket.jl, an ongoing inference process is always interruptible and an inference result is always available.  \r\n- Support for large static data sets. The package is not limited to real-time processing of data streams and also scales well to batch processing of large data sets.\r\n- RxInfer is extensible. A large and extendable collection of precomputed analytical inference solutions for standard problems increases the efficiency of the inference process. Current methods include solutions for linear Gaussian dynamical systems, auto-regressive Models, Gaussian and Gamma mixture models, convolution of distributions, and conjugate pair primitives. \r\n\r\n**Evaluation**: Over the past few years, the ecosystem has been tested on many advanced probabilistic models that have led to several publications in high-ranked journals such as Entropy [1], Frontiers [2], and conferences like MLSP[3], ISIT[4], PGM[5] and others.  A fast and user-friendly automatic Bayesian inference framework is a key factor to expand the applicability of Bayesian inference methods to real-time AI applications. More generally, access to fast Bayesian inference will benefit the wider statistical research community. We are excited to present our work on RxInfer and discuss its strengths and limitations.\r\n\r\n**References**: More at biaslab.github.io/publication/.\r\n\r\n[1] Message Passing and Local Constraint Manipulation in Factor Graphs, Entropy.

TimeStruct.jl makes it simple to change time resolution and provides types for efficient representation of time series for different time structures, including multi-level structures which are common for optimization models for investment analyses, allowing investments only in a subset of time periods. Iterations over the time periods is achieved through the introduction of iterators and the application of multiple dispatch. TimeStruct.jl also includes the implementation of both operational and strategic uncertainty allowing for the implementation of stochastic problems.\r\n#### The base package - EnergyModelsBase.jl\r\nThe core of the energy model is a base package that provides the fundamental building blocks for energy systems such as production, conversion, and consumption of energy by different processes, implemented using JuMP. The base package focuses on operational models and can be easily extended by other packages to add new functionality (e.g., support for investments/capacity expansion or geography), or to add more precise technology descriptions, e.g., using mixed integer or non-linear production functions or constraints through the application of multiple dispatch on both the model type and the technology nodes. The implementation of improved descriptions does not require any modifications to the base package due the applications of Julia's multiple dispatch. This modularity simplifies future development of, e.g., improved technology descriptions due to the separation between technology and framework descriptions. In addition, it allows for fast development of required technology descriptions.\r\n#### Example extension - EnergyModelsInvestment.jl\r\nWhile many larger optimization models in practice only provide users with a limited set of options for investments (e.g., discrete or continuous), InvestmentModels.jl provides types for different classes of investments that can be used in different combinations, e.g., discrete, continuous, or semi-continuous, and provides extra functionality in dependencies between projects (e.g., not allow investing in project A until project B is in operation). The modelling of investment options is separated from the modelling of technology and time structure, allowing easy customization to different use cases. The use of custom types and multiple dispatch also facilitates more efficient model creation, by only generating the necessary (binary) variables for the chosen investment options.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26250, "code": "ALT38V", "public_name": "Julian Straus", "biography": null, "answers": []}, {"id": 18046, "code": "ASSCEF", "public_name": "Lars Hellemo", "biography": null, "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 28923, "guid": "f514e532-20ef-5600-9935-1771362713a8", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-27T12:00:00-04:00", "start": "12:00", "duration": "00:30", "room": "32-082", "slug": "juliacon2023-28923-learning-jump-by-example", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/SMUP8H/", "title": "Learning JuMP by example", "subtitle": "", "track": "JuMP", "type": "Talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Get an up-to-date overview of the modelling capabilities of JuMP through a number of worked examples.

Julia's ability to easily integrate mathematical libraries and perform multiple dispatch has enabled me to streamline the calculation of these topological invariants.\r\n\r\nOne of the key features of non-Abelian topological invariants is that they are not captured by traditional static and field-theoretic approaches. In this work, I will focus on a specific class of non-Abelian topological invariants known as the Euler invariants.

By evaluating these invariants numerically, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of their properties and their potential applications in the field of quantum physics. In particular, I will demonstrate how the degeneracies of the quasi-energy bands give rise to a implicitly defined manifold with multiple components that form a complicated knots. To evaluate the topological invariants, one has to calculate integrals of the wave function on the knotted structure of the manifold. By utilizing DifferentialEquations.jl, manifold.jl, and ForwardDiff.jl, I am able to parallelize these calculations and explore the space of topological phase transitions efficiently. I will present how these packages can effectively work together without going into details.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my research aims to utilize the Julia ecosystem to evaluate non-Abelian topological invariants numerically, with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the exotic material properties they give rise to.

Their simplicity enables systematic study of the quantum properties, which has notable applications in, e.g., quantum computing. With ReducedBasis.jl we provide a Julia package, which uses reduced-basis methods to accelerate the modeling of parametrised eigenvalue problems, such as typical for quantum spin Hamiltonians. The package integrates with ITensors enabling a treatment using state-of-the-art tensor network methods.", "description": "A central objective in quantum spin models is to understand the physical behaviour of the system across the parameter domain of the associated Hamiltonian. Mathematically one wishes to compute the eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue (the ground state) at each parameter instance. Since the Hilbert space dimension (thus the size of the Hamiltonian) scales exponentially with the size of the physical system, each ground state computation is associated with a considerable cost. In contrast to an exhaustive systematic scan over the parameter domain, [ReducedBasis.jl](https://github.com/mfherbst/ReducedBasis.jl) follows a recent approach based on the reduced basis method (RBM) [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.045303). In this approach, a surrogate model is assembled by projecting the full problem onto a basis consisting of only a few tens of parameter snapshots, the only instances where the ground state needs to be computed. These snapshots are selected following a greedy strategy, which aims to maximally reduce the estimated error with each additional snapshot. Once the RBM surrogate has been assembled physical observables (e.g. for mapping out phase diagrams) can be computed for any parameter value with a modest complexity, notably scaling independently from the dimension of the Hilbert space.\r\n\r\nEven though the motivating applications for ReducedBasis.jl are quantum spin systems, the package is intended to be generally applicable to parametrised eigenvalue problems with a low-dimensional parameter space. Key steps of the RBM procedure can therefore be easily customised. Most importantly this concerns details on the \"ground truth\" method used for obtaining the eigenstates at the selected snapshots: Currently both broadly applicable standard iterative diagonalisation methods such as LOBPCG as well as specialised tensor network methods such as the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) approach are supported. Both modes of operation will be illustrated in our talk, where we apply ReducedBasis.jl to both a simple parametrised eigenproblem, a chain of Rydberg atoms as well as to one-dimensional quantum spin-1 models featuring rich quantum phase diagrams. Compared to a traditional approach using only DMRG and ITensors.jl we demonstrate a manyfold speedup when DMRG calculations are complemented by ReducedBasis.jl. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with Matteo Rizzi (Universit\u00e4t K\u00f6ln), Benjamin Stamm (Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart) and Stefan Wessel (RWTH Aachen).\r\n\r\n[1] [M.

These kinds of graphs are often very large, so efficient graph alignment algorithms are essential for many applications.

It is designed to solve a relaxed version of the above formulation, in which the convex-hull of the permutation matrices, i.e. doubly stochastic matrices, is considered as a feasible region. In this way, the Frank\u2013Wolfe algorithm can be applied to find a doubly stochastic matrix, which is subsequently projected by solving a linear assignment problem, onto the set of permutation matrices, finding an approximate solution.The linear assignment problem is also used at each iteration of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and is the bottleneck of the procedure.

The author found that long-term fluctuations in data, if decomposed into frequency components, are such that the amplitudes of the components decrease smoothly with decreasing periods. This type of dynamics implies long-lasting autocorrelations; that is, they exhibit long-range dependence. Long-range dependence has been estimated in temperature data, political affiliation data, financial volatility measures, inflation, and energy prices, to name a few. Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of long-range dependence on data can have perverse effects on statistical methods if not included in the modelling scheme.  \r\n\r\nThis talk presents a package for modelling long-range dependence in the data. We develop methods to model long-range dependence by the commonly used fractional difference operator and the theoretically based cross-sectional aggregation scheme. The fast Fourier transform and recursive implementations of the algorithms are used to speed up computations. The proposed algorithms are exact in the sense that no approximation of the number of aggregating units is needed. We show that the algorithms can be used to reduce computational times for all sample sizes. \r\n\r\nMoreover, estimators in the frequency domain are developed to test for long-range dependence in the data. A broad range of estimators are considered: the original Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) estimator, local Whittle (LW) variants that allow for non-de-meaned data, bias-reduced versions of both GPH and LW methods, and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) in the frequency domain for the fractional differenced and cross-sectional aggregated data. For the latter, the profile likelihood is obtained for efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe proposed package is simple to implement in real applications. In particular, we present an exercise using temperature data modelled using standard and long-range dependence models. The experiment shows that the standard model misrepresents the prediction confidence intervals of future global temperatures.

Conversion and upgrade of that library is in the process but before improving the optimisation process, current efforts are made to ensure that the Julia version reproduces the original Fortran version.

The aim is usually to identify promising geometry for a specific application. Many operations repeat mechanically, and are tedious and time consuming. In specific, the mesh creation is a fundamental but routine task, similar but not identical for all the airfoil and all the test cases. This is where GmshAirfoil.jl comes in handy.", "description": "It allows the user to create in a few clicks a .geo file containing all the information for the open-source widely used GMSH software to create properly structured meshes. Before exporting the mesh, the user can visualize the preview, and modify almost all the parameters (number of divisions and or the growth ratio in the inlet, airfoil surface or shear ...) and see the new results in real-time. The package also adds the physical tag (inlet, outlet, airfoil and limits) to the entities relieving the workload from the user. The mesh created is compatible with the most popular CFD software (Fluent, STARCCM+). In reality, this package, was born to create airfoil meshes that are compatible with the FEM package Gridap.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this package is to create a .geo that can be read by GMSH. It has been decided to write a .geo file and not directly the .msh file for three main reasons. Firstly, the .geo file is easy to read and interpret. In this way, the user can perform some easy changes directly on it, without the need to dig deeply into the code. Secondly, it can be imported into GMSH, all the parameters can be modified so the user can visually verify that the mesh is good enough for its purpose. Lastly, the API of GMSH for Julia at the moment does not provide all the features that are needed. The package is simple but quite powerful, it provides basically only two functions:\r\n-\tfrom_url_to_csv: the user can browse on the airfoiltools.com website looking for the profile to analyze. It is the biggest database of airfoil online. As the name of the function suggests, it creates a .csv file where the airfoil points are stored. This function comes in handy when the user does not have the file with the points of the profile.\r\n-\tmain_create_geofile: is heart of the package. It allows to create the .geo file. Here its plenty of optional argument that the user can specify to achieve a results closer to his needs:\r\n- Reynolds number: this is used to compute the boundary layer characteristics over the airfoil. An optimal combination of meshing parameters is defined by employing some empiric formulas and setting some constraints on the number of cells in the boundary layer and the growth ratio. In the boundary layer, a sufficient number of cells is needed (at least 30 in a turbulent case), a growth ratio G between 1.05 and 1.2, and we have to ensure that y+ is approximately 1.\r\n- First layer height: sometimes this is the value that the user wants to ensure. Usually, it comes from previous simulations or other authors work.\r\n- Chord: is set c=1 by default, but this value can be overrided.\r\n- Dimensions: 2D or 3D.\r\n - Elements: TRI/TETRA or QUAD/HEXA, can be the shape of the single element.\r\nWe have not specified yet because this mesher is defined as \"smart\". As shows in the previous section, it automatically compute the optimal mesh characteristic requiring no additional work form the user. Furthermore, it is able to distinguish the trailing edge (rear part), the leading edge, the suction side (top part) and pressure side (bottom part). It automatically fixes two point close to the trailing edge, one on the suction and one on the pressure side, in order to create the inlet region.\r\n\r\nIt can detect the shape of the trailing edge, that can be sharp or not, and so the mesh will be different. Meshing the trailing edge has always been troublesome for engineers due to its strong curvatures and strange shapes. \r\n\r\nFor a 3D mesh, the user can specify the boundaries surfaces normal to x-axis to be periodic.\r\n\r\nThe mesh, once the .geo file is open in GMSH, is highly customizable. The user can specify the number of nodes in the inlet section, over the airfoil, over the vertical lines, in the shear, as well as the geometrical growth of the cells. The user can also define the length of the domain. Furthermore, it creates a refinement region close to the airfoil in order to customize the parameters to have a better-refined mesh.\r\nThe user can also specify the angle of attack of the profile, which is a fundamental parameters for evaluating airfoil performance. By default it is set to zero. Increasing the AoA leads the airfoil to rotate, as well as the shear and refinement mesh.\r\nClass Shape Transformation (CST) is also implemented.

PRONTO is a direct method for trajectory optimization which solves the optimal control problem directly in infinite-dimensional function space. It is capable of achieving quadratic convergence and has potential applications ranging from aerospace to quantum sensing.", "description": "At the core of the PRONTO algorithm is a nonlinear projection operator which maps curves to the system's trajectory manifold. Encoding the dynamics constraint through this operator creates an unconstrained optimization problem which is then solved via Newton descent. In the best case, PRONTO can achieve quadratic convergence. PRONTO has proven to be an effective tool for solving large quantum control problems, finding optimal satellite maneuvers, and studying the dynamics of high-performance vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its efficacy, previously existing implementations of PRONTO had a substantial learning curve. The algorithm requires the definition of Jacobians and Hessians of the dynamics and cost functions, all of which needed to be manually implemented in C++. Systems with tens of states necessitated the calculation of hundreds of derivatives - this process was rather work intensive and would often lead to mistakes hidden deep in byzantine code. Further analysis of results was typically done in MATLAB, and this two-language approach made it difficult to gain insights on some aspects of the algorithm's behavior. A pure MATLAB implementation of PRONTO was performance limited to small systems at low resolutions.\r\n\r\nTo increase the accessibility and usability of this powerful algorithm without sacrificing performance, Julia was a natural choice. Initially, we were expecting to accept a small reduction in performance in exchange for dramatically increased usability. However, thanks to insights gleaned from an array of profiling and code introspection tools created by the Julia community, we were able to not just match the performance of the C++ implementation, but substantially exceed it.\r\n\r\nThe majority of computations in the PRONTO algorithm consist of solving a series of about 10 ODEs, some forward, and some backward in time. Consequently, the performance of the internal ODE solver is extremely important. Rather than being limited to an explicit Runge-Kutta (4,5) algorithm, in PRONTO.jl we make use of the power and flexibility of DifferentialEquations.jl, and can adjust algorithms and settings to suit the requirements of the problem. Furthermore, the solver-aware interpolation methods used by DifferentialEquations.jl result in a more efficient representation of each ODE solution, storing less data while being more accurate and requiring fewer extra solution steps than a fixed-step linear interpolation.\r\n\r\nPRONTO.jl utilizes the symbolic differentiation provided by Symbolics.jl to compute the necessary Jacobians and Hessians, and the resulting functions are then fine-tuned using Julia's metaprogramming and expression manipulation functionalities. Since PRONTO.jl can automatically generate substantial portions of its own code, the user only needs to provide 5 functions: the dynamics, stage and terminal costs, and a pair of regulator matrices. This greatly reduces the burden on the user, reduces implementation errors, and results in more readable code. Ultimately, this substantially cuts down on the time required to implement new models, which can now be spent exploring novel problems.\r\n\r\nPRONTO.jl enables us to study a set of problems that were previously prohibitively difficult to implement, and more importantly makes this powerful tool accessible to a broader research community.

In this talk, we introduce [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl), a Julia package dedicated to the automatic generation and analysis of BST models of metabolic and signal transduction networks. [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl) features a simple domain-specific language (DSL) that specifies the model reaction network, methods to estimate steady-state and dynamic solutions to BST models, and methods to conduct global sensitivity analysis of BST model parameters.\r\n\r\nWe construct and analyze BST models of the thrombin generation dynamics of synthetic patients before and during pregnancy to demonstrate the features of the [BSTModelKit.jl](https://github.com/varnerlab/BSTModelKit.jl) package. Women are at higher risk for a blood clot during pregnancy, childbirth, and up to 3 months after delivering a baby. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that pregnant women are up to 5 times more likely to experience a blood clot than women who are not pregnant. A synthetic population of pregnant women was developed from patient data to understand better this increased clotting risk. Measurements of 11 coagulation factors involved with the regulation of thrombin generation and measurements of the hormones Estradiol and Progesterone were collected longitudinally from N = 38 women at three visits: V1 non-pregnant, V2 first trimester, and V3 third trimester. A corresponding Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) was conducted for each patient sample, and parameters describing the dynamics were extracted.\r\n\r\nA joint probability model (assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution) was constructed from this matched data by computing the mean vector and covariance arrays from the experimental measurements. The probability model was then used to generate synthetic patient populations (dimension 1k, 10k, and 100k patients) that could be used in subsequent Machine Learning (ML) studies. One such ML study gauged how representative the synthetic population was of the original data. Next, an ordinary differential equation BST model of coagulation dynamics in individual patients was developed from the synthetic population and used to predict the patient TGA parameters. Patient-specific BST model parameters were estimated and used to simulate TGA patient data; the synthetic-patient BST models were consistent with true-patient TGA measurements. Further, global sensitivity analysis of the BST models identified which model parameters controlled the different aspects of the TGA measurements. Finally, by clustering the synthetic and actual patient data, using a radial basis function distance metric, our synthetic population recapitulated the empirically measured differences between the non-pregnant and pregnant states. \r\n\r\nThe following grants supported this work: The Interaction of Basal Risk, Pharmacological Ovulation Induction, Pregnancy and Delivery on Hemostatic Balance NIH NHLBI R-33 HL 141787 (PI\u2019s [Bernstein](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/provider/ira-m-bernstein-md), [Orfeo](https://www.med.uvm.edu/biochemistry/lab_orfeo_research)) and the Pregnancy Phenotype and Predisposition to Preeclampsia NIH NHLBI R01 HL 71944 (PI [Bernstein](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/provider/ira-m-bernstein-md)).", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26304, "code": "QLXKQ8", "public_name": "Jeffrey Varner", "biography": "Jeff Varner holds a Ph.D. in Engineering from Purdue University.

We present RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Julia package for neural network models that are constructed to naturally satisfy robustness constraints. We discuss the theory behind our model parameterisation, give an overview of the package, and demonstrate its use in image classification, reinforcement learning, and nonlinear robotic control.", "description": "Modern machine learning relies heavily on rapidly training and evaluating neural networks in problems ranging from image classification to robotic control. However, most existing neural network architectures have no robustness certificates, making them sensitive to even small input perturbations and highly susceptible to poor data quality, adversarial attacks, and other forms of input disturbances. The few neural network architectures proposed in recent years that offer solutions to this brittle behaviour rely on explicitly enforcing constraints during training to \u201csmooth\u201d the network response. These methods are computationally expensive, making them slow and difficult to scale up to complex real-world problems.\r\n\r\nRecently, we proposed the Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) architecture as a computationally efficient solution to these problems. The REN architecture is flexible in that it includes all commonly used neural network models, such as fully-connected networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The weight matrices and bias vectors in a REN are directly parameterised to naturally satisfy behavioural constraints chosen by the user. For example, the user can build a REN with a given Lipschitz constant to ensure the output of the network is quantifiably less sensitive to unexpected input perturbations. Other common options include contracting RENs and input/output passive RENs. \r\n\r\nThe direct parameterisation of RENs means that no additional constrained optimization methods are needed to train the networks to be less sensitive to attacks or perturbations. We can therefore train RENs with standard, unconstrained optimization methods (such as gradient descent) while also guaranteeing their robustness. Achieving the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d in this way is unique to our REN model class, and allows us to freely train RENs for common machine learning problems as well as more difficult applications where safety and robustness are critical.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present our RobustNeuralNetworks.jl package. The package is built around the AbstractREN type, encoding the REN model class. It relies heavily on key features of the Julia language (such as multiple dispatch) for a neat, efficient implementation of RENs, and can be used alongside Flux.jl to solve machine learning problems with and without robustness requirements, all in native Julia. \r\n\r\nWe will give a brief introduction to the fundamental theory behind our direct parameterisation of neural networks, and outline what we mean by nonlinear robustness. We will follow this with a detailed overview of the RobustNeuralNetworks.jl package structure, including the key types and methods used to construct and implement a REN. To conclude, we will demonstrate some interesting applications of our Julia package for REN in our own research, including in:\r\n\r\n- Image classification\r\n- System identification\r\n- Learning-based control for dynamical systems\r\n- Real-time control of robotic systems via the Julia C API\r\n\r\nUltimately, we hope to show how RENs will be useful to the wider Julia machine learning community in both research and industry applications.

Conformal Prediction is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and model-agnostic and it works under minimal distributional assumptions.", "description": "### \ud83d\udcc8 The Need for Predictive Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\nA first crucial step towards building trustworthy AI systems is to be transparent about predictive uncertainty. Machine Learning model parameters are random variables and their values are estimated from noisy data. That inherent stochasticity feeds through to model predictions and should be addressed, at the very least in order to avoid overconfidence in models.\r\n\r\nBeyond that obvious concern, it turns out that quantifying model uncertainty actually opens up a myriad of possibilities to improve up- and down-stream tasks like active learning and model robustness. In Bayesian Active Learning, for example, uncertainty estimates are used to guide the search for new input samples, which can make ground-truthing tasks more efficient ([Houlsby et al., 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5745)). With respect to model performance in downstream tasks, predictive uncertainty quantification can be used to improve model calibration and robustness ([Lakshminarayanan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474)).\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc49 Enter: Conformal Prediction\r\n\r\nConformal Prediction (CP) is a scalable frequentist approach to uncertainty quantification and coverage control ([Angelopoulus and Bates, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511)). CP can be used to generate prediction intervals for regression models and prediction sets for classification models. There is also some recent work on conformal predictive distributions and probabilistic predictions. The following characteristics make CP particularly attractive to the ML community:\r\n\r\n- The underlying methods are easy to implement.\r\n- CP can be applied almost universally to any supervised ML model, which has allowed us to easily tab into the existing [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) toolkit.\r\n- It comes with a frequentist marginal coverage guarantee that ensures that conformal prediction sets contain the true value with a user-chosen probability.\r\n- Only minimal distributional assumptions are needed.\r\n- Though frequentist in nature, CP can also be effectively combined with Bayesian Methods.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude14 Problem: Limited Availability in Julia Ecosystem\r\n\r\nOpen-source development in the Julia AI space has been very active in recent years. [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) is just one great example testifying to these community efforts. As we gradually build up an AI ecosystem, it is important to also pay attention to the risks and challenges facing AI today. With respect to Predictive Uncertainty Quantification, there is currently good support for Bayesian Methods and Ensembling. A fully-fledged implementation of Conformal Prediction in Julia has so far been lacking.\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udf89 Solution: `ConformalPrediction.jl`\r\n\r\nThrough this project we aim to close that gap and thereby contribute to broader community efforts towards trustworthy AI. Highlights of our new package include:\r\n\r\n- **Interface to [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/)**: turning your machine learning model into a conformal predictor is just one API call away: `conformal_model(model::MLJ.Supervised)`.\r\n- **Many SOTA approaches**: the number of implemented approaches to Conformal Regression and Classification is already large and growing.\r\n- **Detailed [Di\u00e1taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) Documentation**: tutorials and blog posts, hands-on guides, in-depth explanations and a detailed reference including docstrings that document the mathematical underpinnings of the different approaches.\r\n- **Active Community Engagement**: we have coordinated our efforts with the core dev team of [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) and some of the leading researchers in the field. Thankfully we have also already received a lot of useful feedback and contributions from the community.\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udfaf Future Developments\r\n\r\nOur primary goal for this package is to become the go-to place for conformalizing supervised machine learning models in Julia. To this end we currently envision the following future developments:\r\n\r\n- Best of both worlds through **Conformalized Bayes**: combining the power of Bayesian methods with conformal coverage control.\r\n- Additional approaches to Conformal Regression (including time series) and Conformal Classification (including Venn-ABER) as well as support for Conformal Predictive Distributions.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the list of outstanding [issues](https://github.com/pat-alt/ConformalPrediction.jl/issues).\r\n\r\n### \ud83e\uddd0 Curious?\r\n\r\nTake a quick interactive tour to see what this package can do: [link](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fpat-alt%252FConformalPrediction.jl%252Fmain%252Fdocs%252Fpluto%252Fintro.jl).

Matching the results of simulations to the available observational and experimental data requires estimating the sensitivity of the model to changes in its parameters. The adjoint method for computing sensitivities gains more attention in the scientific and engineering communities. This method allows for computing the sensitivities in the entire parameter space using the results of only one forward solve, in contrast to the direct method that would require runninng the forward simulation for each parameter separately.\r\n\r\nRecent breakthrough innovations in compiler technologies resulted in wide adoption of the paradigm of differentiable programming, in which the entire computer program could be differentiated via automatic differentiation (AD). Differentiable programming allows for automated generation of adjoints from the forward model.

With OpenTelemetry.jl, users can not only analyze the telemetry data in Julia but also across many other different languages or services.", "description": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nLogs, traces, and metrics are used independently to help diagnose systems for a long time. As applications are becoming more complex and more heterogeneous, pinpointing a problem is more difficult than before. Formed through a merger of the OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects, [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is aimed to improve the situation. In addition to [the concrete specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification), OpenTelemetry comes with a collection of APIs and SDKs in many different programming languages. As for now, Julia is not included yet. And that's why we created [OpenTelemetry.jl](https://github.com/oolong-dev/OpenTelemetry.jl). By fully respecting the OpenTelemetry specification, data collected in Julia with OpenTelemetry.jl can be analyzed together with those from other languages uniformly.\r\n\r\n## Highlights of OpenTelemetry.jl\r\n\r\n- **Simple API**\r\n\r\n  The APIs are elaborately designed by balancing conventions in Julia and specifications stated in OpenTelemetry.\r\n\r\n- **Fully Configurable**\r\n\r\n  Most components in `OpenTelemetrySDK` are configurable (either explicitly through keyword arguments or with environment variables). Users can decide how to collect the data, when to send the data, and where to store them. With the architecture of OpenTelemetry, users can choose any APM which supports the OpenTelemetry collector.\r\n\r\n- **Pluggable auto instrumentation**\r\n\r\n  Several commonly used packages in Julia are already auto-instrumented (Downloads.jl, Genie.jl, HTTP.jl, CUDA.jl, etc). Users can simply enable them by importing corresponding instrumentation packages.\r\n\r\n- **It's FAST**\r\n\r\n  The API layer and SDK layer are separated by design. The API layer is lightweight enough so that package developers can safely add it as a dependency with only very little overhead introduced. Our benchmark results show that the implementation in Julia is much faster than many SDKs in other languages.\r\n\r\n## Agenda\r\n\r\nThis talk contains the following three parts:\r\n\r\n1. A general introduction to OpenTelemetry and its benefits.\r\n2.

The mathematics of the electronic structure theory is both conceptually difficult and computationally  \r\nintensive, making the development of readable packages challenging.\r\n\r\nWith `WTP.jl`, we simplify the development process by providing abstractions for commonly used concepts in electronic structure theory that are tricky to implement. Moreover, we design our interface to resemble the mathematical notation of electronic structure theory to minimize the effort in translating the theory into code.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `WTP.jl` includes functions for working with nonorthogonal periodic grids and objects defined on such grids.

As a leader in a small data organization, you have to be careful about adopting new technologies, because you don't have any capacity to spare. That's why I'm here today to share my experiences with adopting Julia and give you a better understanding of its potential for your team.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'll cover the advantages of using Julia in your data team. You've heard that Julia is faster and easier for setting up your projects (and replicating your results in the future). But it's the Julia design philosophy and its ecosystem that makes it so productive to use. In addition, its tooling and community provide tons of learning opportunities, so you'll keep growing and improving just from your everyday work. Additionally, Julia has an unbeatable time to insight - not just the execution time, but end-to-end, from starting the project to sharing the insights with stakeholders, I'll demonstrate what I mean and why that is.\r\n\r\nOf course, no technology is perfect. I'll also be discussing some of the downsides to using Julia, such as internal challenges, the difficulty in finding talent with Julia skills and some red flags when you shouldn't adopt Julia (eg, large existing code, strict cross-dependencies, or deployment requirements.)\r\n\r\nBut the most compelling reason to consider Julia is its unreasonable effectiveness. I'll be sharing a few examples of how Julia has supercharged our small team and how you can benefit from it too (eg, workflow setup, re-use via small packages, documentation system, composability of tools, user-friendly APIs on custom types)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly some downsides to adopting Julia, the advantages and its unreasonable effectiveness make it a worthy consideration for data, insights and decision intelligence teams. I hope that by sharing my experiences and examples, I've been able to give you a better understanding of whether Julia is the right choice for your team and how you can effectively adopt it.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 18488, "code": "DLUFRL", "public_name": "Jan Siml", "biography": "A weighted mixture of management consulting/business strategy/change management/data science.", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 26227, "guid": "20a073bb-2a4e-57e3-82db-50eb21e804ee", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-28T10:10:00-04:00", "start": "10:10", "duration": "00:10", "room": "32-123", "slug": "juliacon2023-26227-pigeons-jl-distributed-sampling-from-intractable-distributions", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/YGMJXD/", "title": "Pigeons.jl: Distributed sampling from intractable distributions", "subtitle": "", "track": "Statistics and Data Science", "type": "Lightning talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Pigeons.jl enables users to leverage distributed computation to obtain samples from complicated probability distributions, such as multimodal posteriors arising in Bayesian inference and high-dimensional distributions in statistical mechanics.

We demo Pigeons.jl and offer advice to Julia developers who wish to implement correct distributed and randomized algorithms.", "description": "In this talk we provide an overview of Pigeons.jl and describe how we addressed the challenges of implementing a distributed, parallelized, and randomized algorithm, exploiting a strong notion of \u201cparallelism invariance\u201d which we will exemplify and motivate. The talk appeals to practitioners who want to leverage distributed computation to perform challenging Bayesian inference tasks or sample from complex distributions such as those arising in statistical mechanics. We briefly describe how Pigeons uses a state-of-the-art method known as non-reversible parallel tempering to efficiently explore challenging posterior distributions. The talk also appeals to a broad array of Julia developers who may want to implement distributed randomized algorithms. The open-source code for Pigeons.jl is available at https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/Pigeons.jl. \r\n\r\nEnsuring code correctness at the intersection of randomized, parallel, and distributed algorithms is a challenge. To address this challenge, we designed Pigeons based on a notion of \u201cparallelism invariance\u201d: the output for a given input should be **identical** regardless of which of the following four scenarios is used: 1. one machine running on one thread, 2. one machine running on several threads, 3. several machines running, each using one thread (in our case, communicating via MPI.jl), and 4. several machines running, each using several threads. Since (1) is significantly simpler to debug and implement than (2, 3, 4), being able to exactly compare the four outputs pointwise (instead of distributional equality checks, which have false positive rates), is a powerful tool to detect software defects. \r\n\r\nTwo factors tend to cause violations of parallelism invariance: (a) task-local and thread-local random number generators, (b) non-associativity of floating point operations. We discuss libraries we have developed to workaround (a) and (b) while preserving the same running time complexity, including a Julia SplittableRandom stream library (https://github.com/UBC-Stat-ML/SplittableRandoms.jl) and a custom distributed MPI reduction in pure Julia.\r\n\r\nJoint work with: Alexandre Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9, Paul Tiede, Miguel Biron-Lattes, Trevor Campbell, and Saifuddin Syed.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 25779, "code": "CLEGPX", "public_name": "Nikola Surjanovic", "biography": "Nikola Surjanovic is a Vanier Scholar pursuing a PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr. Alexandre Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Dr. Trevor Campbell.

For this domain, a more general\r\napproach is needed than is offered by computational pipeline tools. DataLad and\r\nIntake both represent more general solutions, however both also fall short in\r\nmajor ways. DataLad lacks any sort of declarative data file (embedding info as\r\nJSON in git commit messages), and while Intake has a (YAML \u2014 see\r\nhttps://noyaml.com for why this isn't a great choice) data file format it only\r\nprovides read-only data access, making it less helpful for writing/publishing\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThere is space for a new tool, providing a better approach to data management.\r\nFurthermore, there are strong arguments for building such a tool with Julia, not\r\nleast due to the strong project management capabilities of Pkg.jl and the\r\nindependence from system state provided by JLL packages. An analysis performed\r\nin Julia, with the environment specified by a Manifest.toml, the data processing\r\ncaptured within the same project, and the input data itself verified by\r\nchecksumming, should provide a strong reproducibility guarantees \u2014 beyond that\r\neasily offered by existing tools. A data analysis project can be hermetic.\r\n\r\nOne of the aims of DataToolkit.jl is to make this not just possible, but easy to\r\nachieve. This is done by providing a capable \"Data CLI\" for working with the\r\nData.toml file. Obtaining and using a dataset is as easy as:\r\n\r\n    data> create iris https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv\r\n    julia> sum(d\"iris\".sepal_length) # do something with the data\r\n\r\nThis exercise generates a Data.toml file that declaratively specifies the data\r\nsets of a project, how they are obtained and verified, and even capture the\r\npreprocessing required before the main analysis. DataToolkit.jl provides a\r\ndeclarative data catalogue file, easy data access, and automatic validation;\r\nenabling data management in accordance with the FAIR principles.\r\n\r\nPkg.jl's Artifact system also provides these reproducibility guarantees, but is\r\ndesigned specifically for small blobs of data required by packages. This shows\r\nin the design, with a number of crippling caveats for general usage, such as:\r\nthe maximum file size of 2GB, only working with libcurl downloads (i.e. no GCP\r\nor S3 stored data, etc.), and being unextensible.\r\n\r\nEven if DataToolkit.jl works well in some situations, to provide a truly general\r\nsolution it needs to be able to adapt to unforeseen use cases \u2014 such as custom\r\ndata formats/access methods, and integration with other tools. To this end,\r\nDataToolkit.jl also contains a highly flexible plugin framework that allows for\r\nthe fundamental behaviours of the system to be drastically altered. Several\r\nmajor components of DataToolkit.jl are in fact provided as plugins, such as the\r\ndefault value, logging, and memorisation systems.\r\n\r\nWhile there is some overlap between DataToolkit.jl and DataSets.jl,\r\nDataToolkit.jl currently provides a superset of the capabilities (for instance\r\nthe ability to express composite data sets, built from multiple input data sets)\r\nwith more features in development; and the design of DataToolkitBase.jl allows\r\nfor much more to be built on it.\r\n\r\nThe current plan for the talk itself is:\r\n- An overview of the problem domain and background\r\n- A description of the DataToolkit.jl family of packages\r\n- A demonstration or example of using DataToolkit.jl\r\n- Showing what it takes to implement a new data loader/storage driver\r\n- An overview of the plugin system\r\n- A demonstration of the plugin system", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26244, "code": "RKPNQN", "public_name": "Timothy Chapman", "biography": ".", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 25313, "guid": "b4a1d907-d979-500a-a617-1805832908bd", "logo": "/media/juliacon2023/submissions/L88UBE/comprehensiveFig_kj33ks2.png", "date": "2023-07-28T16:30:00-04:00", "start": "16:30", "duration": "00:30", "room": "32-123", "slug": "juliacon2023-25313-a-data-persistence-architecture-for-the-simjulia-framework", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/L88UBE/", "title": "A Data Persistence Architecture for the SimJulia Framework", "subtitle": "", "track": "Statistics and Data Science", "type": "Talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "We present a novel transparent data persistence architecture as an extension of the SimJulia package. We integrated PostgresORM into the ResumableFunctions library by using Julia's metaprogramming support. As such, we were able to remove the dependency on a user's knowledge on architectures for persistence. Our contribution aims to improve the usability, whilst demonstrating the power of macro expansion to move towards a dynamic object-relational mapping configuration.", "description": "SimJulia is an open source discrete event process simulation framework (Lauwens et al.). The framework transforms processes expressed as functions into resumable functions using the ResumableFunctions library (Lauwens et al.). Both SimJulia and ResumableFunctions are available through the general registry.\r\n\r\nThe current SimJulia implementation lacks functionality to transparently store state variables of such a process. The exploitation of the data generated by a SimJulia simulation depends entirely on the user's knowledge on technology for persistence and how to interact with it from within the simulation model. To mitigate this shortcoming, we extended both the SimJulia and the ResumableFunctions packages by implementing a transparent probing and data persistence architecture, employing Julia's metaprogramming support. Our implementation is based on the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concept (Russell et al.) using the PostgresORM package (Laugier et al.), supported by the PostgreSQL Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), and Julia's macro expansion.\r\n\r\nA simulation model expressed using functions is transformed into resumable functions ready to be run by SimJulia. Our solution exploits the code analysis occurring during a first phase of running a simulation to store a monitored function\u2019s state variables configuration in the database. This is achieved by using a static ORM configuration which maps an argument of such a function to a tuple in the configuration table.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second phase, in which the simulation runs, macro expansion takes place, creating the object definitions based on the configuration saved earlier. During this macro expansion, the static ORM configuration is used to retrieve the tuples that define an object within the dynamic ORM. The dynamic ORM provides an object definition for each process within the simulation model, offering the possibility to describe the state of a process through a materialised object. This aspect aside, the dynamic mapping configuration between object and table is also provided through macro expansion.\r\n\r\nDuring the simulation, the standard working of the SimJulia package is to invoke an array of callback functions to be executed for successive events. The last function in such an array is the newly added probing function. When calling the latter, the process under consideration is matched against the object definitions created earlier through the dynamic ORM. An object describing the state of the process gets instantiated and is persisted again using the dynamically created ORM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration is kept in a versioned way in the database, enabling alteration of the simulation model while retaining the configuration of previous versions. The data and object definitions related to any version of the model are subsequently available in the RDMBS, and can be visualised using the technology of choice.\r\n\r\nThe current proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the usage of the stored data and the versioned object definitions created dynamically during the simulations using the VueJS package. Through the intermediary of an abstraction layer which employs the dynamic ORM, we were able to provide VueJS with the required view on the data. We are currently considering the possibility to externalise the data based on a REST API for the presented architecture.\r\n\r\nOur contribution is twofold. For end users of the SimJulia package, we provide a transparent probing and persistence mechanism, removing the requirement to provide any configuration on this aspect.

The package takes advantage of multiple dispatch and parametric types to allow for more possibilities for financial analysis.  \r\n\r\nMultiple dispatch allows for more flexibility and extensions of the code. For example, Bruno can calculate theoretical historical derivatives prices for a variety of pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo analysis, by simply switching the input types. With few lines of code, theoretical prices can be calculated for many financial derivatives at different points in time. It is important to note that long-term derivative prices and exotic option prices may not be readily accessible without incurring a cost. Thus, many trading and hedging strategies, by necessity are currently based on asset prices. Bruno.jl will allow them to be based on theoretical derivative prices instead.   \r\n\r\nThe modular architecture of Bruno.jl lets finance professionals use the different parts of the package interchangeably, leading to many novel combinations of tools. For example, a key feature of Bruno.jl is that it can produce a distribution of maximum loss that could result from a trading or hedging strategy. These distributions can be estimated with several different time-series simulating processes or derivative pricing models. This information would be valuable to financial practitioners, hedge funds, and market makers as it would help to quantity the risk of a potential strategy before putting the strategy into place. Therefore, Bruno.jl allows for better comparison of different trading and hedging strategies under different assumed market conditions. \r\n\r\nBruno was designed to be used by academic researchers as well as finance practitioners such as derivatives analysts, hedge fund managers, or market makers.

Systems that exhibit these dynamics are known as *complex adaptive systems* (CAS). In these systems, the micro-scale behaviors of individual actors or agents (e.g., retail investors, trading firms, etc.) coalesce to generate *emergent properties* at the macro-scale. In financial systems, emergent properties can manifest unexpectedly and have varying consequences. One example of emergence is the price discovery process, in which the price series of an asset is determined through the individual orders submitted by various buyers and sellers. Other emergent phenomena can be irrational and deviate significantly from historical events, such as a *flash crash* (i.e., a sudden and extreme drop in asset value that can have lingering and widespread effects on the market).\r\n\r\nAgent-based models (ABMs) capture critical features of complex systems\u2014emergent properties, non-linearity, and heterogeneity. These features arise naturally due to the micro-scale interactions; that is, macroscopic properties of the system emerge without being explicitly constrained, or under any assumption, to do so. ABMs typically undergo both a calibration and validation procedure to generate realistic behavior. This entire process is facilitated by a combination of several new packages: Brokerage.jl, Exchange.jl, and ZeroTrader.jl.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we calibrate an agent-based model of risky asset price dynamics and trading behavior by configuring agent-specific parameters through heuristics and machine learning (online recursive least squares). To validate the model, we run statistical tests on the simulation outputs and compare these against actual market behavior (i.e., check for the presence of empirical regularities, or \u201cstylized facts\u201d, through the use of empirical macroscopic data).

It takes 120 hours to complete processing in a single-machine environment, which is time-consuming.\r\nSo, the Falra Distributed Framework (FDF) was developed to allow us to divide the data cleaning and transformation tasks that we need to perform into smaller tasks with simple HTTP POST calls FDF then automatically distributes these tasks for distributed processing. This architecture saves a lot of computing time and development costs. Through FDF, we were able to complete all IoT data transformations in 1/100 of the time. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to the emergence of the scientific computing programming language Julia, a Python program that originally required 100 hosts to operate can now be reduced to 10 machines by using Julia. And through FDF in combination with the ngrok service, it is possible to quickly connect idle hosts around the world for computation. We successfully saved 5 times the cost of cloud host expenses in this data conversion process because of this combination.\r\n\r\nCompared to the native Julia distributed module, the advantage of FDF is that developers do not need to learn how to develop the Julia distributed programming. They can just use their single-machine programs as they used to do. In addition, FDF can be deployed on any network that can be called via HTTPS. There is no need to deal with TCP or other network issues.\r\nBy sharing this distributed architecture, developers who are new to Julia can take advantage of distributed computing from the start. We hope to see more distributed usage scenarios using the Falra framework and share their results with us.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have released the Falra Distributed Framework package on Github (https://github.com/bohachu/Falra.jl) for everyone to use.

The algorithm allows for formulating the update rules for fields in a form close to the explicit time integration. This formulation is optimally suited for both shared and distributed memory parallelization.\r\n\r\nWith respect to implementation, our approach is instantiated in the packages ParallelStencil.jl and ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl. It is fully architecture-agnostic and, for GPU, it includes the automatic generation of on-chip memory usage-optimized computation kernels as well as the automatic determination of their launch parameters. On-chip memory usage-optimization is achieved by explicitly reading large arrays through the memory shared by the threads of a block - when beneficial and when hardware resources allow for it - and by steering register usage in order to keep data that is to be reused whenever possible on the chip. The optimizations are applicable to complex real world applications: a simplified, less on-chip memory requiring optimization strategy can be used for a part of the kernel input arrays when the most aggressive optimization strategy would lead to a resource exhaustion. Kernel launch parameters as blocks, threads and required shared memory can be automatically defined in agreement with the applied optimizations. Furthermore, communication can be automatically hidden behind computation, including with on-chip memory usage-optimization activated.\r\n\r\nWe compare the performance achieved for some representative computation kernels against the performance obtained using alternative ways to express equivalent computations in Julia, for example using GPU array broadcasting or straightforward CUDA.jl kernel programming.

We still see advertisements of newer processors such as GPUs that claim that it is a few times faster than its previous generation. However, on the other hand, the divergence of micro-architecture has produced trouble for application programmers. To enjoy the performance from new hardware, they have to \u201cmigrate\u201d their code in order to work with the new hardware, which creates two major costs: the cost of code migration and the cost of maintaining multiple versions.\r\n\r\nIn regards to GPU programming, Julia supports several packages such as CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl and oneAPI.jl. Currently, using these packages is a de-facto standard of Julia GPU programming. However, I argue that this approach has demerits seeing from the porting point of view: 1) it does not reduce the cost of code migration and the cost of maintaining multiple versions, 2) it does not support coexistence of multiple GPU programming paradigm such as CUDA and OpenACC, 3) the latest updates in the Julia GPU packages always come next after vendor\u2019s updates.\r\nFirst, the user has to port the entire code to Julia. Even after completing the porting, the user may need to maintain the old application, possibly written in Fortran or C/C++. There could be many reasons for maintaining both versions such as the eco-system that a community has built around the old application. Secondly, supporting coexistence of multiple GPU programming is especially important now when there is no single winner for GPU programming. Instead of betting on a single GPU programming framework, you may want to transit from one framework to another smoothly when a newer framework is desirable. Lastly, it is obvious that the maintainer of the Julia GPU programming framework should wait until the vendor publicly distributes the latest updates.\r\n\r\nJulia Accelerator Interfaces(JAI, https://github.com/grnydawn/AccelInterfaces.jl) tries to solve the three issues identified above by using shared libraries that include GPU kernels and GPU vendor interfaces. JAI consists of three main functions: 1) Julia GPU programming interface using Julia macros. With the macros, Julia programmers can create and run GPU kernels in the way similar to a directive based GPU programming such as OpenACC or OpenMP target. 2) Automated shared library generation that implements kernels and vendor API interfaces. To create the shared library, JAI relies on external vendor-provided compilers instead of Julia internal GPU compilation infra-structure. In this way, JAI can leverage the newest feature of vendor-provided compilers as well as the benefit of Just-in-time (JIT) compilation. 3) Automated call to functions implemented in the shared libraries using Julia ccall interface. Because this boiler-plating works are hidden from JAI user interface, users can write JAI GPU code at high-level abstraction and JAI can accommodate API changes on the vendor-side.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the features of JAI, we ported a Fortran miniWeather (github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather) OpenACC version that simulates weather-like flows for training in parallelizing accelerated HPC architectures to jlweather (https://github.com/grnydawn/jlweather) that utilize an OpenACC-enabled compiler. For the sake of performance comparison, we also ported minWeather to the pure Julia version and to the manually GPU-ported version too. The versions are deployed and executed at two US-based supercomputing centers (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17pDiiMnTuy8oscQ9-NmxEZ7SltWU4dhUrD2-51ot6ew/edit?usp=sharing). The experiments show that the jlweather OpenACC version is about 25% faster than Fortran OpenACC version with medium workload while slower with small workload.\r\n\r\nIn JAI, kernels are not ported to Julia. Instead, the user provides JAI with the body of the kernels in the original languages such as Fortran. And then, JAI generates kernel source files and compiles them to shared libraries. The kernel body is located in an external text file in a simple INI-format file, called KNL file. In a KNL file, multiple versions of kernel-body can co-exist and JAI automatically selects the best version. For example, if a KNL file contains a kernel body in CUDA, HIP, and Fortran version, JAI can first try to select HIP or CUDA version to check if the system supports the framework. If none of them is supported on the system, JAI may select the Fortran version as a backup. This JAI feature for coexisting multiple GPU programming frameworks allows users to migrate code gradually from one kernel to another kernel, not the entire application at once. As of this writing, JAI supports kernel-bodys written in CUDA, HIP, Fortran-OpenACC, Fortran-OpenMP-Target, Fortran, and C/C++.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 24427, "code": "FH9J3E", "public_name": "Youngsung Kim", "biography": "Youngsung Kim is a software performance engineer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. \r\n\r\n* Julia Accelerator Interfaces(JAI): embrace conventional languages(Fortran, C, C++) as well as GPU programming(Cuda/Hip, OpenAcc, OpenMP) within Julia.", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 26856, "guid": "e5af49b0-baaf-5144-b1d5-89393b7a11d0", "logo": "", "date": "2023-07-28T15:00:00-04:00", "start": "15:00", "duration": "00:30", "room": "32-124", "slug": "juliacon2023-26856-exploring-synthesis-of-flexible-neural-machines-with-zygote-jl", "url": "https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/talk/F7WKU7/", "title": "Exploring synthesis of flexible neural machines with Zygote.jl", "subtitle": "", "track": "General Machine Learning", "type": "Talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "We were able to successfully synthesize simple compact high-level neural machines via a novel algorithm for neural architecture search using flexible differentiable programming capabilities of Zygote.jl.", "description": "We are studying an interesting class of flexible neural machines where single neurons process streams of vectors with tree-shaped indices rather than streams of numbers (see https://anhinga.github.io/ and https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07447, \"Dataflow Matrix Machines and V-values: a Bridge between Programs and Neural Nets\"). These machines are expressive enough to be used for general-purpose stream-oriented programming (dataflow or functional reactive programs). They are also expressive enough to flexibly and compositionally modify their own weight-connectivity matrices on the fly. They can be thought of as flexible attention machines, with neuron inputs computing linear combinations of vectors with tree-shaped indices and thus working as attention devices.\r\n\r\nWe would like to explore a variety of machine learning experiments using this class of neural machines. In particular, it would be nice to be able to use differentiable programming and gradient methods in those experiments. Traditional machine learning frameworks would necessitate difficult engineering work reshaping those flexible tree-shaped vectors into flat tensors. \r\n\r\nZygote.jl provides flexible differentiable programming facilities and, in particular, allows users to take gradients with respect to variables aggregated inside a tree. That makes it a perfect fit for our machine learning experiments with flexible neural machines.\r\n\r\nWe consider the following novel algorithm for neural architecture search. Consider neural architectures where connections between neural modules are gated with scalar multipliers. Start with a sufficiently large network and perform sparsifying training of this network on a set of test problems using sparsifying regularization and gradually pruning inter-module connections with low gating weights.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the neural modules are powerful \"super-neurons\" of dataflow matrix machines. In our exploratory set of experiments we consider a duplicate character detector problem (a hand-crafted compact neural machine solving this problem is described in Section 3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470, \"Programming Patterns in Dataflow Matrix Machines and Generalized Recurrent Neural Nets\").\r\n\r\nThe history of our preliminary experiments is documented at https://github.com/anhinga/DMM-synthesis-lab-journal/blob/main/history.md\r\n\r\nThese are moderate scale experiments successfully performed on a home laptop CPU.\r\n\r\nZygote.jl is quite awesome, but using it is still not without some difficulties. In particular, while \"backpropagation theorem\" promises us reverse-mode gradients at cost of the corresponding forward computation multiplied by a small constant, in practice we often observe larger slowdowns (presumably this happens when the forward computation is friendly to compiler optimizations, while the induced gradient computation is not). When this slowdown is still moderate one can successfully use Zygote.jl. When the slowdown starts to exceed two-three orders of magnitude, it makes sense to switch to the stochastic approximation of gradient computations via OpenAI flavor of evolution strategies even if one is computing sequentially and not on a cluster (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06564, \"On the Relationship Between the OpenAI Evolution Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent\" by Xingwen Zhang, Jeff Clune, and Kenneth O. Stanley).\r\n\r\nIn our case, we have initially bumped into heavy slowdowns and memory swaps when trying to perform this neural synthesis in the most ambitious prior-free manner starting with a fully-connected recurrent machine with long backpropagation through time. \r\n\r\nBecause we have been aiming to synthesize feedforward circuits with local recurrences, we decided to scale our ambition down and rely on some priors and start with fully connected feedforward machines with skip connections and local recurrences.\r\n\r\nThen we have obtained acceptable performance and have been able to synthesize very compact, human-readable neural machines with rather remarkable generalization properties using a tiny training set.\r\n\r\nThese are very exciting preliminary results where nice-looking compact, human-readable neural circuits approximating a hand-written neural program have been automatically synthesized for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this line of exploration will be continued, by ourselves and by other people.

One of the main uses of MD is in computational drug discovery, where simulating a target protein with a candidate drug (ligand) allows one to predict their binding affinity before conducting expensive wet-lab experiments. MD computations are by no means cheap: to get meaningful results multi-day simulations on high-performance machines are often necessary. For that reason, most popular MD engines are written and performance engineered in C++ in order to make best use of the hardware.\r\n\r\nBiosimMD.jl is wholly written in Julia, which made it possible to match and surpass the performance of state-of-the-art C++ engines. The package makes extensive use of the ability to access low-level compiler and CPU features e.g. SIMD operations. At the same time, the ability to test new algorithms at a high level made it possible to quickly research and prototype the best performing code.

While there are good off-the-shelf force-fields for proteins, that is not the case for ligands (candidate drugs).

That is because many of the concepts in our multi-objective setting are generalizations of well-known single-objective pendants.\r\nLike in single-objective optimization, optimization problems with multiple objectives and nonlinear constraint functions might arise in a multitude of areas in the natural sciences, engineering, or economics. Whereas trust-region ideas allow for a relatively straightforward modeling of objective functions to design derivative-free descent algorithms, they cannot handle \u201cdifficult\u201d constraint functions without modifications. But the composite-step approach and the Filter mechanism can be adapted from single-objective optimization, enabling the same modeling techniques for constraints as well.

For a Hermitian matrix, this amounts to constructing a unitary transformation that brings it into a diagonal form. Traditional iterative algorithms, such as the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm or the QR algorithm, accomplish this in a series of discrete steps. In the continuum limit, the unitary transformation is instead performed in a continuous fashion, as described by isospectral flows. Solving the ODEs modeling such an isospectral flow numerically in turn corresponds to an iterative eigenvalue algorithm. The QR algorithm, for example, emerges when sampling a particular isospectral flow at unit intervals [1].\r\n\r\nEigenvalue algorithms based on continuous isospectral flows have proven particularly useful for studying closed quantum many-body systems whose properties are determined by their Hamiltonian - a Hermitian matrix whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of system constituents. In this case, the operator structure of typical physical Hamiltonians can be exploited to introduce approximations that enable the analysis of larger systems [2].\r\n\r\nFormulating eigenvalue algorithms based on continuous isospectral flows in a differentiable manner allows for the efficient and accurate computation of derivatives of physical quantities of interest, such as (time-dependent) expectation values of observables, with respect to Hamiltonian parameters.

For the forward simulation of the ODEs, we utilize OrdinaryDiffEq.jl and custom implementations of solvers respecting the isospectrality of the flow.

The concept is to use a prediction model of the future response of the system and then determine the optimal control inputs that optimize the future evolved trajectory. Thus, an (expensive) online optimizer is called at each time step with the requirement that a solution is available before the next time step. The first of these control inputs is then passed onto the plant model (or actual system). An observer (such as a Kalman filter or variants) is used to provide an estimate of the system state which is fed back to the predictive controller for the next time step. The need for an online optimizer commonly results in a limitation of the sample rate of the system or the length of the prediction horizon which may make MPC intractable for nonlinear systems with fast dynamics. Furthermore, it necessitates verification of the optimizer especially for safety-critical applications. \r\n\r\nThis work presents an alternative approach for optimizer-free control that both results in a substantial speedup over online optimization and removes the need for optimizer verification. The method followed is to simulate the MPC controller for several sampled reference conditions as well as initial states and train a neural network-based surrogate to learn the control law from the simulated data. We discuss the philosophy followed and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of constructing a surrogate for the optimizer versus for both the optimizer and the observer.

Modelling the temporal evolution of networks and predicting their structure is an open challenge across a wide variety of disciplines: from the study of ecological networks as food-webs, to predictions about the structure of economical networks; from the analysis of Social Networks, to the modelling of how our brain develops and adapts during our lives.\r\n\r\nIn their usual representation, networks are binary (an edge is either observed or not), sparse (each vertex is linked to a very small subset of the network), large (up to billions of nodes), and changes are discrete rewiring events. These properties make them hard to handle with classic machine learning techniques and have barred the use of some mathematical modelling frameworks such as differential equations. In this talk, we show how we used Julia, and in particular the Scientific Machine learning (SciML) framework, to model the temporal evolution of complex networks as continuous, multivariate, dynamical systems from observational data. We took an approach cutting across different mathematical disciplines (machine learning, differential equations, and graph theory): this was possible largely thanks to the integration of packages like Graph.jl (and the integrated MetaGraph.jl package) with the SciML ecosystem, e.g., DiffEqFlux.jl, via graph embeddings in metric spaces.\r\n\r\nFor this latter task, we will present a novel Julia package called [DotProductGraphs.jl](https://www.github.com/gvdr/DotProductGraphs.jl) to easily and efficiently compute graph embedding, building on interpreting networks as Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG).\r\n\r\n**Methodology**\r\n\r\n1. To translate the discrete, high-dimensional, dynamical system into a continuous, low-dimensional one, we rely on a network embedding technique. A network embedding maps the vertices of a network to points in a (low-dimensional) metric space. We adopt the well-studied Random Dot-Product Graphs statistical model: the mapping is provided by a truncated Singular Value Decomposition of the network\u2019s adjacency matrix; to reconstruct the network we use the fact that the probability of interaction between two vertices is given by the dot product of the points they map to. The decomposition of the adjacency matrices and their alignment is a computationally intensive  step, and we tackle it thanks to the fast matrix algorithms available for Julia implemented in our novel DotProductGraphs.jl package.\r\n\r\n2. In the embedding framework, a discrete change in the network is modelled as the effect of a continuous displacement of the points in the metric space. Our goal then, is that of discovering from the data (the network observed at various points in time) an adequate dynamical system capturing the laws governing the temporal evolution of the complex network. This is possible thanks to a pipeline that combines Neural or Universal ODEs and the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, e.g. SiNDY.\r\n\r\nIn general, each node may influence the temporal evolution of every over node in the network, and, if we are working in a space with dimension d, and N nodes, this translates to a dynamical system with N*N*d variables. As networks may often have thousands or millions of nodes, that number can be huge. In our talk we are going to discuss various strategies we adopted to tame the complexity of the dynamical system.\r\n\r\n**Future Development**\r\n\r\nWe are now working on three fronts:\r\n- we are scaling up the framework, so to model larger networks (for example to model social networks, where being able to predict what people might link with others in the future could be a tool to fight the growing problem of misinformation and disinformation);\r\n- we are progressively moving from Neural Differential Equations to Universal Differential Equations, both to capture any preexisting knowledge of the network dynamical system, and to help with the training complexity;\r\n- we are exploring data augmentation techniques to interpolate between the estimated embeddings, other embeddings, and other neural network architectures.\r\n\r\nThese three development directions constitute interesting challenges for the Julia practitioner interested in extending Julia modeling abilities.

In this talk, we are going to present the motivations behind the package, its major goals and current functionalities, and prospect our expectations for the following releases.", "description": "In the early 1970s, Jay Forrester, a notable and pioneer researcher in several fields, designed the first system dynamics model intended to analyze the complex interactions between high-level subsystems of the world, in order to understand the evolution of a major variable in each subsystem (in particular, the population, the capital investment, the natural resources, the fraction of capital devoted to agriculture, and the pollution level variables). His model, called World2, was published in the 1971 book \"World Dynamics\" and subsequently evolved into the World3 model, described in the well-known 1972 book \"The Limits to Growth\" by Meadows et al. Since then, several similar models were developed, such as the quite popular DICE model from the Nobel Prize laureate William Nordhaus, and categorized as Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which can be roughly divided into two general classes: policy optimization and policy evaluation models. DICE is a policy optimization model in which, intuitively, we look for a set of parameters (that is, a policy) which maximizes a specific objective variable (or function). On the other hand, the WorldX models (which recently evolved in the Earth4All model) can be considered as policy evaluation models, in which we decide a policy (that is, a set of parameter values) and analyze the behaviour of some major variables (or functions). Benefiting from Julia's ecosystem for scientific computing and referring to this classification, WorldDynamics.jl has been developed to support the construction of policy evaluation IAMs and has already been applied to the reproduction of several historical models.\r\n\r\nWorldDynamics.jl leverages the ModelingToolkit.jl ability to compose differential-algebraic systems of equations. Indeed, an IAM is usually structured into several different subsystems whose variable interactions are modelled by differential-algebraic equations. As such, the goal of the model is to understand the evolution of some major variables. WorldDynamics.jl emphasizes this modular structure of IAMs by facilitating the coding of the systems of equations corresponding to the different subsystems and their composition by automatically deriving the connections among them (that is, their shared variables). By doing so, WorldDynamics.jl allows a designer to focus on a specific subsystem without necessarily knowing how another person is developing a different subsystem (interestingly, this seems to be how the well-known World3 model was described and, most likely, developed). Moreover, this approach easily allows the substitution of one system of equations (representing one subsystem) with another system of equations (still representing the same subsystem), provided that it correctly interacts with the other subsystems (intuitively, respecting the required input/output variable interface).\r\n\r\nAs an open-source package, WorldDynamics.jl also tries to democratize access to distinct models as well as to promote transparency among them. Even if most of the current models are freely available for reproduction, they are usually implemented using proprietary software, which prevents us from verifying precisely their internal operation and, hence, how the models are simulated exactly. By using Julia and its notable packages, WorldDynamics.jl provides a flexible framework that allows the usage of several solvers and integration with different methods with a reduced effort. Its current features include the implementation of the entire Club of Rome series of models with the possibility of easily replicating all the plots of their major variables that appeared in the literature, and changing parameter values and systems of equations in order to evaluate different policies. In conclusion, WorldDynamics.jl allows model construction in a simplified way while enabling the application of modern scientific computing techniques over new and classical models.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we are going to present the WorldDynamics.jl package as a whole.\r\nWe start with the motivations behind its creation followed by a historical display of classic models. Then, we emphasize our main goals and the challenges encountered during the development process (including how we translated equations from the DYNAMO language), explain the modular approach for implementing IAMS, and describe all the currently implemented models. Finally, we conclude the talk by indicating future works and a roadmap for the next releases. The presentation is intended to give the audience a general explanation of WorldDynamics.jl goals and capabilities. Along with this talk, we are also submitting a workshop proposal to interactively demonstrate the functionalities of WorldDynamics.jl with several hands-on examples.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26270, "code": "QSVLRA", "public_name": "Pierluigi Crescenzi", "biography": "Pierluigi Crescenzi is a professor at the Gran Sasso Science Institute.

In that previous work, I conducted a pilot study to characterize prevalence rates in mental health care for [intersectional subpopulations](https://jacobzelko.com/11042022141714-what-intersectionality-theory/#workable_definitions_of_intersectionality) suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, and/or suicidality. This work utilized novel tooling and approaches created within Julia to successfully analyze data from ~2.5 million Medicaid subscribers within the U.S. state of Georgia. This work earned the [highest awards at the top observational health research venue](https://www.ohdsi.org/2022-collaborator-showcase), drove another successful grant proposal, and resulted in [multiple invited talks](https://www.nahdo.org/conference/2022/agenda). Buoyed by the interest and success of this pilot work, my team and I have moved this project into the next phase: the examination of more than 100 million patients from more than 4 countries across the globe.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present advances within the JuliaHealth community and the broader Julia ecosystem that have made possible such large scale and federated analyses. In particular, novel JuliaHealth tools such as [OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl](https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/) will be highlighted to show how to analyze \"big\" [real world data](https://jacobzelko.com/10282021140730-real-world-evidence/#united_states_food_and_drug_administration_definitions), how using Julia can be of huge benefit within this space, and how Julia community members could start using these tools for their own research. As this study now takes place across multiple countries, time will also be spent discussing how Julia lends itself very well to robust analyses using literate programming tools such as [Quarto](https://quarto.org) or [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl) and versioning processes through [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) or [Data Version Control](https://github.com/iterative/dvc), which can be utilized to handle each country's specific needs. Additionally, I will spend some time discussing issues encountered (both technical and anthropological), ways that the Julia ecosystem could potentially grow to support future work in this research domain, and opportunities for Julia users to get involved. Finally, I will share my personal thoughts on what open questions there are to be addressed in observational health research and how Julia can be a tool to address public health questions and provide insight into questions of health disparities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this talk will highlight the real world use of Julia in large-scale health research studies built on real world data. Moreover, it will show the potential of the various ecosystems within Julia to analyze and tackle complex questions within health equity. Through this talk, I invite future Julia users and researchers to join me in pursuing the potential of Julia within the space of observational health research.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 9292, "code": "WNALCB", "public_name": "Jacob Zelko", "biography": "My name is Jacob S.

(A single dense matrix with 30k genes and 500k cells takes 120GB RAM.)\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl is the first comprehensive Julia Package for processing Single Cell Expression data.\r\nIt is at least 5 times faster and uses less than 1/5 of the memory, when doing the same analysis as existing packages written in other languages.\r\n\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl supports the standard workflow for Single Cell Expression data:\r\nSparse matrices with raw gene expressions counts (~5-10% nonzeros) are transformed (e.g. using SCTransform or log transform) and then normalized (e.g. mean-center, regress out covariates).\r\nNext, a truncated SVD (i.e. Principal Component Analysis) is computed to bring the data down from 30k dimensions to ~100 dimensions, which also serves as noise reduction.\r\nThis is a great starting point for downstream analysis, partly because the data set is now much smaller.\r\nUMAP and t-SNE visualization are supported using external packages, and Force Layout (also known as SPRING plot) support is built-in.\r\n\r\nAs the name indicates, SingleCellProjections.jl is also built for projections.\r\nA common use case is that there is good, well-annotated reference data set (e.g. healthy cells), that the user wants to relate their own, newly generated data set (e.g. cancer cells) to.\r\nBy projecting the new data onto the reference data set, similarities and differences can be interpreted in terms of the reference data set.\r\nProjection is here used in a broad sense, describing all steps after loading the raw count data until the analysis is done.\r\nComputing the projection in SingleCellProjections.jl is very simple:\r\n```\r\nnew_data = load_counts(filepaths)\r\nproject(new_data, base)\r\n```\r\nUnder the hood, SingleCellProjections.jl has stored a `ProjectionModel` for each analysis step that was applied to the base data set, with all the information needed to compute the projection for that step, and applies the models one by one to project the new data.\r\nNote that projecting is rarely the same as running the same analysis step independently, as the model is built from the source data.\r\nThis can be subtle and easy to forget, but the simple interface hides this complexity from the user, minimizing the risk for mistakes.\r\nAt the same time, it is easy to customize some steps if needed.\r\n\r\nThe key to performance and low memory usage in SingleCellProjections.jl is to never store large, dense matrices.\r\nInstead, matrix expressions are created and manipulated to implicitly represent the same information internally.\r\nAs a motivating example, consider a sparse matrix `S` and let `A := S - m1\u1d40` be the matrix after mean-centering.\r\nHere, `m` is a vector with the mean for each gene (variable) and `1` is a vector of ones.\r\nSingleCellProjections.jl avoids materializing the large dense matrix `A` by working with the expression object directly.\r\nThis strategy generalizes to more advanced transforms and normalizations, yielding slightly more complicated matrix expressions, consisting of sparse and/or low-rank terms and factors.\r\nContinuing the example from above, note that it is much more efficient to compute `AX` for some matrix `X` by distributing over the sum and evaluating `SX - m(1\u1d40X)`, than to work with the materialized matrix `A`.\r\nRandomized subspace iterations (Halko et al) are used to compute the truncated SVD (i.e. PCA), relying only on such matrix-matrix products.\r\nTo efficiently compute the matrix-matrix products, SingleCellProjections.jl internally solves a generalized Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, taking both size and structure of the matrices into account.\r\n\r\nJulia is very well suited for working with complicated, high-dimensional, biological data.\r\nIn particular, the ability to write both high level code and efficient low-level code has been immensely useful when implementing this package.\r\nReproducibility, which is very important for scientific analyses, is also greatly improved by Julia - in part by Manifests, but also by execution speed, since the user is more likely to rerun an analysis rather than loading some partial result from disk.\r\nWe hope that SingleCellReductions.jl is a good starting point for anyone who wants to perform Single Cell expressions analyses and benefit from the Julia language and its ecosystem.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nHalko et al, \"Finding Structure with Randomness: Probabilistic Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Matrix Decompositions\"", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 26301, "code": "YCNJP8", "public_name": "Rasmus Henningsson", "biography": "Rasmus Henningsson\u2019s research interests are centered around high-dimensional biological data in general and Leukemia in particular.

Using graph theory, optimization problem components (e.g., variables, constraints, objective functions, or data) are stored within nodes and edges of a graph. This provides convenient visualization of the model, and it can lead to applications of various decomposition schemes to exploit the structure of the model. In this talk, I will present how we use Plasmo.jl and MadNLP.jl for building and solving graph-based optimization problems and how these packages can be used for exploiting some problem structures. \r\n\r\nWe use the package Plasmo.jl for building graph-based optimization problems [1]. This package extends JuMP.jl, and provides an interface for defining the optimization problem components within nodes and edges of a graph. Plasmo.jl uses an abstract modeling object called an OptiGraph which is composed of OptiNodes (similar to JuMP.jl\u2019s Model object and which can store variables, constraints, objective functions, and data) and OptiEdges (which store constraints for variables on different OptiNodes and which capture connectivity of components). \r\n\r\nWe also use the package MadNLP.jl for solving graph-based optimization problems [2]. This package is a nonlinear interior-point solver similar to IPOPT. MadNLP.jl can interface with Plasmo.jl to solve problems defined within an OptiGraph, and it has the capability of exploiting OptiGraph structures using different decomposition schemes. Both Schwarz [2] and Schur [3] decompositions are enabled within MadNLP.jl, and these have been shown to reduce solution times. We are also interested in developing further decomposition schemes for graph-structured problems. \r\n\r\n1. Jalving, J., Shin, S., and Zavala, V.M. 2022.
